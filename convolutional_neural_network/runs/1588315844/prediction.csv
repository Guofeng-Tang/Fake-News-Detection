"advertisement square , site wide",1.0
"joshua scheer my guest right now is professor reece jones , he s a geopolitical expert he teaches geography at the university of hawaii manila his book is violent borders we re discussing refugees thank you for joining me",1.0
reece jones thanks for having me on,1.0
"scheer you ask this question in the book , and obviously every day there s some big story about migrants and refugees and what s happening in the world we just saw it yesterday with the so called jungle being torn down in france this morning i woke up to the bbc saying 238 migrants may have drowned outside of libya you study this , talking about limiting the movements of the poor and you ask this question in the beginning of your book talk about this the limiting of the movements of these refugees and what you ve seen , both in your field research , but also in the media reports and everything else that we re all seeing right now we ve seen over the last , certainly the last few years , but this is not a new movement as you write about in your book",1.0
"jones i ve been studying borders for about 15 years now , and over that period of time , i ve seen two big changes happening at borders the first is the construction of a lot of border infrastructure that is designed to limit the movement of people across border spaces and to deter people from trying to make trips across borders this infrastructure is both the deployment of a lot more border agents at borders , the use of new surveillance technologies and military technologies in border spaces , but it s probably most evident if you look at walls",1.0
"walls are a good way to symbolize the hardening of borders that s happened in the past 15 years in 1990 there were about 15 border walls around the world , so relatively few today there are almost 70 walls on borders around the world , so there s been a dramatic increase in the number of walls those walls symbolize all of the other infrastructure that goes along with that the militarization of the security in these spaces",1.0
"the second trend that i ve noticed that goes along with that is a dramatic increase in the number of people dying at borders if you look at the edges of the european union , in the 1990s there were less than a hundred deaths per year at the edges of the eu , whereas in the past decade , those numbers have gone up dramatically we re talking about in the last 3 years in a row , over 3 , 500 people have died at the edges of the eu every single year",1.0
"that s part of a global trend from 2005 to 2014 , 40 , 000 people globally died trying to cross the border in the last 2 years , as you mentioned during your introduction , that s increased even more over 10 , 000 people have died trying to cross a border in just 2015 and 2016",1.0
"scheer yes , and you have the number in a lot of numbers in your book , and it s very interesting walls can you explain , we re going to get into the violence aspect , but explain this concept that was foreign to me , humanitarian fencing which you saw in spain and elsewhere what is humanitarian fencing \? how does that relate \?",1.0
"jones in some border areas , there s an effort to construct fencing that is meant to deter people from crossing rather than injure them in the crossing process if you look at the us fence , the one that was built after the secure fence act passed in 2006 , it doesn t have a lot of barbed wire on it , instead it s a wall , it prevents movement , but it doesn t have the ways to injure people crossing the eu fencing in spain for example , is also similar in that respect it doesn t have all the barbed wire that we see in other borders around the world",1.0
"that doesn t mean that it doesn t have a dangerous effect on people s lives , because what we see over and over again is that as particular border crossing routes are closed , fences are always built in the easier places for people to cross between cities , it diverts people to ever more dangerous routes that s why there s been this dramatic increase in deaths , because as borders become harder to cross , we ve seen that it doesn t deter people from crossing as it was predicted to do instead , it forces them to cross in these very dangerous places , which means the deserts of the us southwest",1.0
"in arizona for example , where the number of deaths increased dramatically as fences were built on the us border at the edges of the eu it means the people are crossing in the mediterranean they re having to go to libya , and having to use smugglers and are put in these very dangerous situations , which results in these really high death rates of people trying to cross into europe",1.0
"scheer my guest is reece jones , he s a geography professor at the university of hawaii manila , and his book is violent borders , refugees and the right to move this is not a new concept as you write about though the great wall of china you write about , hadrian s wall , it created a defensive control good taxes , and let s get into that a little bit the walls that were created , like for the great wall of china , and then with feudal lords and common lands using hedges and other mechanisms",1.0
"we start to shift the conversation into the state s responsibility , because as you write in your book , this is not one , as you write or as other geographers have also written , to be modern is to be modern citizen it to be a mobile citizen , and also we have been always in migration our history s in migration let s talk about the history of basically creating walls and then where we have reached today in which states are protecting us and we have this national identity based on borders",1.0
"jones what i argue in the book , the broader argument that i make in the book is that the walls that we see today and all of the security infrastructure that goes along with them at borders , the idea of citizenship , the use of passports , the imposition of border patrols , is new in the way that it s happening at borders , but i argue that it s part of a much longer term history that s part of this contest between people moving around and states efforts to try to control that movement",1.0
"i argue that a powerful historical process is the state using movement restrictions to contain the poor to particular places to lower their wages to to make them have no wages what we see today is part of that longer history in the past it was things like slavery , or serfdom , or vagrancy laws or poor laws , that kept the poor locked into particular places and allowed the wealthy to access their wages to they work at low wages or no wages today we see that with borders",1.0
"the poor are restricted to the countries of their birth and this creates pools of low wage labor that lets corporations move factories to locations where it s advantageous to them , but doesn t allow workers to move to places where they could demand higher wages what i argue in the book is that the violence we see at borders today is part of that effort to contain the poor to particular places to protect the privileges and wealth that have accrued in other places",1.0

"as can be seen on the map above the areas al qaeda and its allies managed to capture so far are only small rural outskirts every attempt to attack actual city estate under roof was repelled by the defenders small infiltrations like shown in the map were immediately cleaned up the marked area is back in the hands of the syrian army it is estimated that the several thousand attackers have so far lost more than 500 men a 1 , 000 more are likely injured every attack has to be carried over mostly open land and is received by heavy artillery fire air attacks ravage their supply and preparation ares",1.0
"the attackers launched over 20 suicide vehicle bombs so far but only a few reached their targets and their damage was limited yesterday one suicide vehicle bomb , ready to be launched for a new attack , was hit by a missile from a syrian helicopter and exploded at its preparation and launching position over 60 rebels were killed by it and their attack had to be call off",1.0
the good news is that the defense is holding the bad news is that the al qaeda rebels received huge amounts of artillery missiles and launchers from their western and gulf sponsors several hundred have been launched at the densely populated areas of west aleppo more than a 100 civilians have been killed by them and several hundred civilians were wounded some of the missiles contained gas and people had to be taken to hospital with extreme breathing difficulties the un envoy condemned these attacks as possible war crimes,1.0
the whole attack operation was launched under the direct supervision of al qaeda in syria leader abu muhammad al golani he was shown in pictures at the rebel headquarter of the attack discussing further operations,1.0

"morsi , elected in 2012 and overthrown in 2013 , is facing several trials after a controversial trial , he was sentenced to death in may 2015 for allegedly participating in violence against the police during the 2011 uprising against former president hosni mubarak , but his court appointed lawyers have appealed that verdict",1.0
an egyptian court cancelled the life sentences on tuesday \( oct 25 \) handed out to former president mohamed morsi and muslim brotherhood chief mohamed badie along with 15 other leaders of the banned group in an espionage case and ordered a retrial,1.0
"the court also cancelled death sentences handed out to 16 other muslim brotherhood members , including top leaders khyrat el sharer and mohamed el beltagy ahmed abdel aty thirteen of the 16 were sentenced in absentia the defendants were accused of spying , funding terrorism and disclosing national security",1.0

"morsi , who has also been sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of leaking state secrets to qatar , has not appointed a lawyer to defend himself and has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the court proceedings , saying he remains egypt 's legitimate president",1.0
"the muslim brotherhood has been blamed for the unrest in egypt , which has resulted in the death of hundreds of people al sisi 's government designated the muslim brotherhood a terrorist group in december 2013 , making even verbal expressions of support punishable by imprisonment",1.0
"hundreds of people have been sentenced to death in a crackdown following morsi 's overthrow seven have been executed , including six defendants sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly participating in militant attacks",1.0
"more than three years after sisi ousted morsi , his promise to restore stability is wearing thin desperation and anger among egyptians is mounting due to increase in food prices , while the double digit inflation rate squeezes poor egyptians",1.0
"according to the middle east monitor , core inflation is at seven year highs , near 14 percent , as a foreign exchange shortage and a hike in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars the government raised electricity prices by 25 40 percent in august and is phasing in a 13 percent value added tax approved by parliament in the same month advertisement",1.0

"title blame government , not markets for monopoly author ron paul text email",1.0
"when time warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm , many feared the new company would exercise near total monopoly power these concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both time warner 's competitors and consumers",1.0
"no , i am not talking about time warner s recent announced plan to merge with at t , but the reaction to time warner s merger with \( then \) internet giant aol in 2000 far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors , the aol time warner merger fell apart in under a decade",1.0
the failure of aol time warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace aol time warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices and or better quality,1.0
"corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors these managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable , quality products thus , laws making it difficult to launch a hostile takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors , workers , and consumers",1.0
"monopolies and cartels are creations of government , not markets for example , the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees similarly , anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations , they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government fortunately , the internet has given americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government licensed lapdogs of the mainstream media this may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web",1.0
"government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations , costs which cripple their smaller competitors big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business",1.0
"examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the food and drug administration s \( fda \) regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug , as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals another example is the dodd frank legislation , which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors",1.0
legislation forcing consumers to pay out of state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically powerful competitors this legislation is being pushed by large brick and mortar stores and internet retailers who are seeking a government granted advantage over smaller competitors,1.0
"many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the federal reserve s inflationary monetary policy perhaps the most famous example of this is the aol time warner fiasco , which was a direct result of the fed created dot com bubble",1.0
"in a free market , mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices and or higher quality monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well connected crony capitalists therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations , taxes , and subsides that benefit politically powerful businesses the most important step is to end the boom bust business cycle by ending the federal reserve",1.0

"these people are barbarians hugo salinas price with regards to the social question in the world , in 1929 a spanish thinker by the name of ortega y gasset wrote a book that really shook up the world titled , the revolt of the masses he was talking about the appearance on the world stage of new individuals",1.0

"i have serious doubts about the survival of our civilization they are all working on the spur of the moment they are experimenting to see if this works and that works and i have very serious doubts about the survival of our civilization under such people i expect that a great crisis is coming we are going to see a great separation and some people are just not going to make it , and the old truths are going to come back into fashion because of the need for survival",1.0

"scott adams is creator of the dilbert comic strip according to his self description , adams is also a hypnotist of many years , trained in observing people and subtle nuances in appearance and body language",1.0
"below is adams post of september 11 , 2016 , checking my predictions about clinton s health , which was republished by russia insider",1.0
"in a blog post i wrote on december 27th , 2015 , i said this",1.0
"bonus thought 1 one of the skills a hypnotist has to master is reading people s inner thoughts based on their body language that s a common skill for people in the business world too , but hypnotists go deeper than looking at crossed arms and furrowed brows we learn to look for subtle changes in breathing patterns , tiny changes in muscle tone , variations in skin color \( blushing or not \) , word choice , pupil dilation , and more i assume law enforcement people look for similar tells when doing interrogations",1.0
"as regular readers know , i m a trained hypnotist and to me , hillary clinton looks as if she is hiding a major health issue if you read malcolm gladwell s book , blink , you know that so called experts can sometimes instantly make decisions before they know why in my case , i am going to make an expert hypnotist prediction about hillary clinton without knowing exactly which clues i am picking up , or whether i am hallucinating them",1.0
prediction i ll put the odds at 75 that we learn of an important clinton health issue before the general election that estimate is based on my own track record of guessing things about people without the benefit of knowing why i think trump is picking up the same vibe he has already questioned clinton s stamina,1.0
"on december 29th , 2015 i blogged that trump would be seen as running unopposed before election day i mentioned clinton s health as a possible reason",1.0
"while i m on the topic , i ll add another prediction to the master persuader series i predict that by the time trump is in the general election and running against clinton , you will start hearing that trump \( lucky hitler \) is for all practical purposes running unopposed as clinton s poll numbers plummet",1.0
"that can happen in a variety of ways one way is if clinton s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying , and trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term , or might be in jail , you start to imagine it as a one person race",1.0
and you will that s how you get a landslide,1.0
"look for the words running unopposed in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day and it still counts if it started here , because it won t catch on unless it actually fits",1.0
on april 29th of 2016 i expanded on the thought in this post,1.0
"i have blogged and tweeted that hillary clinton looks unhealthy to me and i have mentioned on twitter that one of the skills of a hypnotist is identifying subtle bodily changes observation is a huge part of a hypnotist s skill you look for micro changes in muscle tone , breathing , posture , and anything else that can tell you whether your technique is working or you need to quickly pivot to a new approach think of it as rapid a b testing on humans and like any skill , one gets better with practice i have more than three decades of practice for this specific skill",1.0
"what i see in clinton s health is an unusual level of variability sometimes her eyes bug out , sometimes they are tired and baggy sometimes she looks puffy , sometimes not it would be easy to assume fatigue is the important variable and that is clearly a big factor but notice that the other candidates have little variability in their physicality trump always looks like trump cruz always looks like cruz , and so on sometimes we think we can detect fatigue in their answers , but visually the other candidates appear about the same every day",1.0
"clinton , on the other hand , looks that suggests some greater variability in her health and that s probably a tell for medications that are waxing and waning but rarely at the ideal levels or perhaps the underlying conditions have normal variability or both",1.0
under normal circumstances it would be deeply irresponsible for a cartoonist to give a medical diagnosis to a stranger he hasn t met i trust you to ignore my medical opinions i do this to build a record of my persuasion related predictions and to show you the method,1.0
"i give clinton a 50 chance of making it to november with sufficiently good health to be considered a viable president judging from her performance on the campaign trail , she is managing her health effectively to get the job done but i would think most people who run for president end up sacrificing their health in some measure the big question is how much buffer she has left",1.0
"to be clear , there is no dependable evidence of clinton having an undisclosed major health issue but it looks that way to observers",1.0

title a federal judge just ordered the rnc to reveal its voter fraud pact with trump author grant stern text comments,1.0
federal judge john michael vazquez set a court appearance for this thursday for the democratic national committee s emergency legal action to fight republican minority suppression efforts,1.0
"the dnc filed suit over a generation old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years , which prevents illegal republican voter suppression ballot security measures",1.0
"that lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed , resulting in an order barring republicans across the country from targeting minority voters the rnc s response pointedly omitted any defense of the michigan and pennsylvania rnc members accused of unlawful ballot security programs , who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves vp candidate mike pence and trump campaign manager kellyanne conway",1.0
the federal judge ordered both michigan gop chairwoman ronna romney mcdonald mitt romney s niece and pennsylvania gop chairman rob gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today,1.0
"last night , republican lawyers tossed the two high ranking rnc members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions , sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today the democrat s strongest claims are against the two national rnc members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs",1.0
"the washington post wrote about the pennsylvania gop s plans to flood urban philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers , while t he michigan state gop chairwoman was quoted in the detroit free press as saying she was directing measures in michigan to launch a massive anti fraud effort",1.0
"under the 1982 agreement between the parties as it s been modified through the years , any ballot security program must be submitted to the court and dnc for preclearance ten days before being implemented it seems highly unlikely that the dnc was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained",1.0
"the republican national committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public , video recorded comments by vp nominee mike pence and media reports about the trump campaign manager kellyanne conway s statements after the third and final debate additionally , the national republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the rnc and the trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well",1.0
"the democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the rnc is involved nationally in poll security operations , which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities the rnc denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings",1.0
"the republican national committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement , and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out however , the republican party of trump isn t playing by the rules , like it s standard bearer doesn t play by the rules , and now they re likely going to be punished",1.0
"tonight , the music stops and the republicans will finally have to answer for their dirty campaign tactics , or face the wrath of a federal judge",1.0

title breaking clinton s intelligence briefings suspended indefinitely following latest in email scandal christian times newspaper author nan text 0 share,1.0
law enforcement and national intelligence officials have suspended hillary clinton s weekly intelligence briefings after further information regarding the democratic nominee s use of private emails has surfaced,1.0
"according to sources familiar with the briefing process , senior officials notified the clinton campaign on sunday afternoon that several federal agencies no longer believed it was either appropriate or prudent for a candidate to receive classified intelligence briefings while under a significant and ongoing investigation",1.0
"while the fbi and department of justice continue their independent investigations and while the law enforcement community continues to search for answers , it would be unwise to continue national security briefings amidst a very serious investigation concerning threats to national security",1.0
it is customary for the major party nominees to receive weekly classified intelligence briefings from senior defense and intelligence officials in order for the eventual president to be fully knowledgeable on matters of national security both clinton and donald trump have received these briefings since their respective party conventions in june,1.0
"on friday , the director of the fbi , james comey , notified congress that the bureau was effectively reopening its investigation into clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state comey wrote that new emails had surfaced that led investigators to warrant further examination",1.0
"according to sources familiar with the investigation the newly found emails were found on a device of clinton s personal aide huma abedin abedin is married to disgraced ny congressman anthony wiener , and it is believed that the emails were discovered during an ongoing investigation into his sexting scandal",1.0
"this latest revelation , including the suspension of weekly intelligence briefings , does not bode well for the former secretary of state in the final days of a heated election donald trump has seized on the news , and he is expected to continue to do so in the coming week",1.0

"halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches , occultists and satanists all over america , those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead , casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices on october 31st , most people will simply ignore the dark side of halloween we can assure you however , that the creator does not",1.0

"from michael snyder , end of the american dream",1.0
"the vast majority of the population will dress up in costumes , go to parties and eat candy without ever even considering where the holiday came from or what certain people are doing behind closed doors but the truth is that halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches , occultists and satanists all over america , those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead , casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices as you will see below , there is a reason why animal shelters across the country ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year but even our innocent halloween traditions such as dressing up in costumes , trick or treating and carving jack o lanterns all have their roots in ancient pagan practices and every year the costumes for our young girls become even more sexually suggestive , the horror movies become even more demonic , and the public s fascination with the occult just continues to grow it truly is a festival of death , but most people don t seem to care in fact , experts are telling us that halloween has now become america s second biggest holiday",1.0
"according to the national retail federation , nearly 70 percent of all americans plan to celebrate halloween this year , and spending is expected to shatter the all time record",1.0
"according to the national retail federation s annual survey conducted by prosper insights analytics , total spending for halloween is expected to reach 8 4 billion , an all time high in the survey s 11 year history",1.0
"u s consumers are expected to spend an average of 82 93 , up from last year s 74 34 , with more than 171 million americans planning to partake in halloween festivities this year",1.0
"to give you some context , total halloween spending for 2009 came in at just 4 7 billion dollars so to say that the celebration of halloween is growing would be a tremendous understatement",1.0
"sadly , most people have no idea where this holiday originally came from the truth is that a long time ago catholicism attempted to christianize an ancient pagan holiday known as samhain",1.0
"the origins of halloween are celtic in tradition and have to do with observing the end of summer sacrifices to gods in druidic tradition in what is now britain and france , it was the beginning of the celtic year , and they believed samhain , the lord of death , sent evil spirits abroad to attack humans , who could escape only by assuming disguises and looking like evil spirits themselves the waning of the sun and the approach of dark winter made the evil spirits rejoice and play nasty tricks believe it or not , most of our halloween practices can be traced back to these old pagan rites and superstitions",1.0
"on the wiccan calendar , samhain is one of the most important points on the wheel of the year wiccans believe that it is the day when the god dies , and subsequently they celebrate his rebirth at yule",1.0
"it is also a time when they believe that the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest , and so it is an opportune time for them to contact the dead the following is much more on what wiccans believe about samhain from wicca com",1.0
"samhain , \( pronounced sow in , sah vin , or sam hayne \) means end of summer , and is the third and final harvest the dark winter half of the year commences on this sabbat",1.0
"it is generally celebrated on october 31st , but some traditions prefer november 1st it is one of the two spirit nights each year , the other being beltane it is a magical interval when the mundane laws of time and space are temporarily suspended , and the thin veil between the worlds is lifted communicating with ancestors and departed loved ones is easy at this time , for they journey through this world on their way to the summerlands it is a time to study the dark mysteries and honor the dark mother and the dark father , symbolized by the crone and her aged consort",1.0
"originally the feast of the dead was celebrated in celtic countries by leaving food offerings on altars and doorsteps for the wandering dead today a lot of practitioners still carry out that tradition single candles were lit and left in a window to help guide the spirits of ancestors and loved ones home extra chairs were set to the table and around the hearth for the unseen guest apples were buried along roadsides and paths for spirits who were lost or had no descendants to provide for them turnips were hollowed out and carved to look like protective spirits , for this was a night of magic and chaos the wee folke became very active , pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans traveling after dark was was not advised people dressed in white \( like ghosts \) , wore disguises made of straw , or dressed as the opposite gender in order to fool the nature spirits",1.0
"the ancient practices described in those paragraphs sound very similar to what we do today in many ways , but without a doubt some of the traditions have evolved for example , instead of carving turnips , those that celebrate halloween carve pumpkins today",1.0
"you may not realize this , but wicca is actually one of the fastest growing religions in america and on october 31st , wiccans all over the nation will get together to conduct rituals and cast spells here is a blurb from wikipedia about the wiccan belief in magic",1.0
"during ritual practices , which are often staged in a sacred circle , wiccans cast spells or workings intended to bring about real changes in the physical world common wiccan spells include those used for healing , for protection , fertility , or to banish negative influences 63 many early wiccans , such asalex sanders , sybil leek and alex winfield , referred to their own magic as white magic , which contrasted with black magic , which they associated with evil and satanism sanders also used the similar terminology of left hand path to describe malevolent magic , and right hand path to describe magic performed with good intentions 64 terminology that had originated with the occultist helena blavatsky in the 19th century some modern wiccans however have stopped using the white black magic and left right hand path dichotomies , arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil 65",1.0
"if you are not familiar with these things , you may scoff at such practices but the cold , hard reality of the matter is that they are very real the dark side has power too , and those that have come out of witchcraft can tell you some stories that will stand your hair on end",1.0
"wiccans think of themselves as good , and so they tend to reject blood sacrifices and things of that nature",1.0
"but for those that are deeper into the occult , blood sacrifice is an essential part of halloween as i mentioned above , many animal shelters all over the nation ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year it s the week of halloween , and maybe you don t know this , but if you suddenly wanted to adopt a black cat , you would probably have a hard time that s because thanks to their association with witchcraft , accepted wisdom holds that halloween is a time when people ritualistically mutilate black cats",1.0
"to test if this really was still accepted wisdom , i contacted some animal shelters near to our los angeles office , and they all told me they wouldn t let me adopt a black cat one , the lange foundation the type of animal rescue that takes in cats from city shelters before they can be euthanized was willing to talk to me on the phone and explain if someone were to call and ask specifically for a black cat , that would trigger the policy i would say not today ! said one of the foundation s board members , diana nelson",1.0
"you may not want to believe it , but animals will be killed and little children will be abused on halloween night the following is what one ex witch has sharedregarding her experiences",1.0
"my parents told me before we went around the neighborhood we were going to go by the church \( mormon church \) to get some candy there the church was very close to my grandmother s house , and i knew so from going often",1.0
"we went to the church and what happened next made my blood curdle i was given candy , but that was just a preclude to the sexual abuse that would happen in a satanic ritual on halloween satanists use young children , such as myself , as sexual idols to worship other children receive a far worse fate death i know for some this is more than you can even think to believe , but it is true i can barely write these words because the pain of the truth is almost more than i can bear if it wasn t for the grace and love of jesus christ , i would not even be here writing this at all",1.0
"you may say it doesn t mean that to me , but you are just fooling yourself",1.0
could you take a satanic black mass and turn it into a celebration of jesus \?,1.0
of course not,1.0
and yet so many christians fully embrace halloween and pretend that there is nothing wrong with it,1.0
"for the record , satanists absolutely love halloween the following comes from the official church of satan website",1.0
"satanists embrace what this holiday has become , and do not feel the need to be tied to ancient practices this night , we smile at the amateur explorers of their own inner darkness , for we know that they enjoy their brief dip into the pool of the shadow world we encourage their tenebrous fantasies , the candied indulgence , and the wide ranging evocation of our aesthetics \( while tolerating some of the chintzy versions \) , even if it is but once a year for the rest of the time , when those not of our meta tribe shake their heads in wonder at us , we can point out that they may find some understanding by examining their own all hallows eve doings , but we generally find it simpler to just say think of the addams family and you ll begin to see what we re about",1.0
"satanists consider halloween to be one of the most important holidays of the year on page 96 of the satanic bible , anton lavey wrote the following",1.0
"after one s own birthday , the two major satanic holidays are walpurgisnacht \( may 1st \) and halloween",1.0
isn t that lovely \?,1.0
"despite all of this , most christians in america will happily celebrate halloween on october 31st in fact , one recent survey found that just 8 percent of all christian pastors want their congregations to skip the holiday altogether instead , most of them want their members to invite people to a christian version of halloween at their churches the following comes from charisma",1.0
"two thirds \( 67 percent \) encourage church members to invite friends and neighbors to a fall festival , trunk or treat or judgment house pastors at bigger churches \( those with 250 or more in attendance \) are most likely to ask church members to invite their neighbors \( 86 percent \) to an event at the church those from small churches \( 50 or less in attendance \) are least likely \( 48 percent \)",1.0
"if the gospel is preached , i am all for people going to church on october 31st but all too often these alternative celebrations are nothing more than repackaged versions of the same satanic holiday that the world is celebrating i like how pastor jamie morgan described what our approach to this day should be",1.0
"setting aside a day to celebrate evil , darkness , witchcraft , fear , death and the demonic brings disdain to god period a christian celebrating halloween would be like a satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at christmas while singing , happy birthday , jesus ! the two just don t go together jesus has nothing in common with satan \( 2 cor 6 14 \) , and neither should we",1.0
and the truth is that god has wanted us to have nothing to do with occult practices from the very beginning the following is what deuteronomy 18 9 13 says in the modern english version,1.0
"9 when you enter into the land which the lord your god gives you , you must not learn to practice the abominations of those nations 10 there must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire , or who uses divination , or uses witchcraft , or an interpreter of omens , or a sorcerer , 11 or one who casts spells , or a spiritualist , or an occultist , or a necromancer 12 for all that do these things are an abomination to the lord , and because of these abominations the lord your god will drive them out from before you 13 you must be blameless before the lord your god",1.0
"there will be many people that will read this article and will continue to celebrate halloween just as they normally do if that is you , then you need to understand that engaging in dark practices can open up doors to spiritual darkness for yourself and your entire family",1.0
"if you do that , then that is your choice , but as for me and my house we will serve the lord",1.0

"today s article is about trying to find a cure for the common cold or , more precisely , reviving ancient remedies from medieval europe",1.0
"and speaking of cures for cold , there s another saying in my neck of the woods if you take cold medicine , you ll get better in seven days , otherwise you ll be sick for a week",1.0
do you see where this is going \?,1.0
"let me tell you another interesting little story despite the fact that there are only a small number of basic ingredients to be found in otc \( over the counter \) cold medicine around ten , give or take \( ephedrine , ibuprofen , paracetamol , aspirin , pseudo ephedrine etc \) the number of cold related drugs in your pharmacy is in the hundreds",1.0
each major pharmaceutical company that has a hand in the cold industry typically has at least 10 different types many have 20 or 30 or even more,1.0
"that s pretty confusing , especially when you re knocked out by a bad case of flu or cold , you can t think straight , and you just want something to get you out of your misery you ll gladly spend a bunch of money to feel better",1.0
little do you know you re wasting it on pure crap do you think i am exaggerating \?,1.0
"basically , in the cold medicine racket , the name of the game is making money via marketing and brainwashing have you noticed the huge number of drug ads on tv \? 70 of the money a television is making outside an election is from big pharma , so let that sink in really well",1.0
"i am writing this article because last week i suffered from a bad case of cold , which rendered me pretty much useless until i started making and drinking an old cold cough remedy that i learned from my grandmother",1.0

"let me tell you how it all began awake at 4 am can t think , can t write , can t breathe , stuffy nose , sore throat does it sound familiar \?",1.0
"well , i managed to crawl to my car and hit a local pharmacy i bought some stuff pompously titled cold medicine , got home , medicated myself , hit the bed , and woke up 3 hours later still feeling horrible",1.0
"then , it hit me my grandmother used to make onion tea when i was little and i had a bad case of cold i remember it smelled awful and tasted like rotten pig guts , but if i was a good boy and drank a lot of it , it worked",1.0
"with these things in mind , i went to the kitchen , gathered 3 onions , washed em up pretty good , and put them in the kettle to boil",1.0
"the idea is to take 2 3 small onions and boil them slowly in a full kettle until the water is reduced by half via evaporation , then drink the tea as hot as you can stand it",1.0
"trust me folks , it really works sore throat gone , stuffy nose gone , i was alive again it does taste hideous , unless you re a die hard onion lover , but it s a small cost to pay",1.0
"basically , with this magic potion you ll be able to function , to be active to be alive , so to speak , from day 1",1.0
"you must drink two 3 4 cups of tea per day , essentially one in the morning and one before bed , that s important",1.0
"if you manage to squeeze 3 more in during the day , it will work like a swiss watch",1.0
"if all you have in the house are big fat onions , you ll just have to cut them in half before boiling it , but remember don t remove the peel that s essential just wash the onion thoroughly",1.0

another way of naturally treating a stuffy nose nasal congestion is tomato tea,1.0

"add a pinch of salt into the mix and heat them together in the kettle until they start boiling , then drink the tea as hot as you can take it",1.0
"during the day , you can drink a mix of green tea and ginger tea with honey , as these ingredients boost the immune system and they break up phlegm naturally \( the drugs are called expectorants \)",1.0
"streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is a common occurrence when it comes to seasonal colds and flu , and besides my aforementioned magic onion tea recipe , you should try 2 additional tricks if you want to get better asap first , gargle with apple cider vinegar after you dilute it in a glass of warm water \( 1 3 teaspoons of vinegar in 8 oz of water \)",1.0
"second , gargle with salt water and if you re hardcore , you can try rubbing your infected tonsils with salt \( using your finger that is \) it s not a pleasant experience , but it works amazingly well you can boost the recipe s effectiveness by adding powdered cayenne pepper into the mix",1.0
"add one teaspoon of cayenne pepper plus one teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz glass , and mix well together , obviously gargle vigorously with this formula until you get better it will definitely break up the bacteria coating in your throat so expect to spit profusely for a couple of minutes afterwards",1.0
"it s very important to use high quality , organic salt not refined processed stuff i would recommend himalayan salt \( the pink variety \) , or salt mine salt \( the one that looks dirty \) processed , refined , snow white salt doesn t work too great as it s stripped of its essential trace elements",1.0

"as public frustration helps sound the death knell for the drug war , its arbitrary laws and policies appear even more absurd in the latest inexcusable enforcement of an antiquated law , 76 year old disabled veteran lee carroll brooker will live out what should be his golden years behind bars for simple possession of cannabis",1.0
"brooker had been treating multiple chronic conditions with cannabis he grew in his son s backyard but when officials in alabama officials discovered the three dozen plants , they threw him in prison for life without the possibility of parole",1.0
thanks to a pointless mandatory minimum sentencing catchall and the supreme court s refusal to hear his case this week brooker has been left little recourse but to ultimately die in jail for treating his ailments with a plant,1.0
"alabama , like three other states , mandates a life without parole sentence for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana by people with certain prior felony convictions and mr brooker had been convicted of a string of robberies twenty years earlier in florida , crimes for which he served ten years in prison , the new york times explained in such a case , the law doesn t require prosecutors to prove any intent to sell the drug",1.0
"essentially , brooker has been imprisoned twice for the same crime because he sought relief from nature instead of arguably dangerous , legal and often lethal pharmaceuticals , courtesy of big pharma worse , alabama s already irrational law sets the cutoff in a case like this at 2 2 pounds \( 1 kilogram \) , and brooker s plants weighed just 2 8 pounds but that included unusable parts , like stalks and leaves",1.0
"make no mistake this is an unjust law , an unjust conviction , and a ridiculous capitulation by the supreme court to alabama s archaic notion a nonviolent offense should somehow land a vet behind bars for life and separate him from his medicine as if law were an inflexible monster to be beholden to , no matter its worth",1.0
"in fact , as the times pointed out , w hile the sentence was mandatory , the prosecutor was not required to bring the precise charges that triggered it prosecutorial discretion here , as in most cases , is a central factor in determining what punishment defendants face",1.0
"in other words , the prosecutor railroaded brooker over his personal , medicinal plants by choice brooker , who joined the u s army at age 17 and came under fire in both lebanon and the dominican republic , eventually rose to the rank of sergeant in the 82nd airborne where he was decorated for infantry service",1.0
"vox reported that even notoriously conservative alabama chief justice roy moore characterized brooker s sentence as excessive and unjustified and according to the times , the judge deciding the vet s fate would have preferred to hand down a lighter sentence , but once the charges had been brought as they were , he was obligated to enforce the letter of the law",1.0
"yes , this disabled man technically broke the law but proffering such a rebuttal rings hollow , if not cold , considering the majority of americans support cannabis legalization legality does not dictate morality",1.0
"a growing segment of officials and public figures do , as well , as the free thought project reported recently , more than 1 , 000 police , world leaders , celebrities , and others signed a letter calling to summarily end the disastrous war on drugs",1.0
"in fact , though little comfort to brooker now , the drug enforcement agency will likely downgrade cannabis from its inexplicable schedule 1 classification to schedule 2 as early as july of this year note that while a plethora of viable arguments can be asserted for rescheduling , considering states with laws like alabama s and cases like brooker s the slight concession by federal law would make a comparative , whopping difference",1.0
"brooker attempted to bring his case before the highest court in the land as an inarguable violation of the constitution s ban on cruel and unusual punishment to no avail the court s stonewall , in itself , could be considered as much in an increasing number of states , brooker s so called crime would have been perfectly legal",1.0
"for now , though , it appears the 76 year old will suffer the consequences of bad policy , unjustifiable law , and the cruelty of ostensible authority figures who were all just doing their jobs",1.0

,1.0
"in an appearance on msnbc on monday , carville relentlessly and repeatedly attacked the fbi s decision to reopen the investigation into hillary clinton , asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert american democracy",1.0
,1.0
"this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election , carville claimed it s unprecedented the house republicans and the kgb are trying to influence our democracy , he said",1.0
,1.0
"apparently the fact that the soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast , anti clinton conspiracy organized by the fbi , according to carville poor carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of comey s announcement , describing it as an assault or attack on american democracy multiple times",1.0
,1.0
"he was also adamant about who was responsible comey was acting in concert and coordination with the house republicans , carville said we also have the extraordinary case of the kgb being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the clinton campaign that they hacked , he claimed",1.0
"carville was very upset that comey s announcement thrust clinton s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight it would seem to me that the fbi shouldn t be getting rolled by the house republicans , that s what happened here there s nothing else that s going on and in the meantime democracy is under assault by the kgb , he said to me that s something we ought to be talking about",1.0
,1.0
"unfortunately for carville , whilst fanciful tales about time traveling soviet spies and an fbi on the gop s take certainly make for interesting entertainment , they pale in importance to the real life stories of clinton s brazen lawlessness",1.0
"when the msnbc anchor dared raise the fact that democrats were praising comey only a few months ago when he announced the fbi s decision not to recommend indictment , carville went into a stuttering , sputtering fit hillary reboots vast right wing conspiracy playbook clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit fbi director comey and criminal probe as politically motivated",1.0
,1.0
"when the facts change i change my mind , carville said why are you defending this , why are you sitting here as american democracy is under assault \? he asked angrily faced with the democrats clear double standard",1.0
,1.0
"this is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the house republicans , carville repeated and as we know the kgb is all over this election and this is what we are talking about \? we ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it , not what somebody said in july about james comey",1.0
"title surviving off grid 5 ways to manage chimney creosote author carmela tyrell text carmela tyrell november 6 , 2016 surviving off grid 5 ways to manage chimney creosote",1.0
"the government is doing everything it can to deter people from burning wood , it still remains popular with home owners that don t want to use oil or other more expensive fuels wood is also very popular with off gridders , preppers , and homesteaders because it can be harvested from natural resources or grown for this purpose",1.0
"many people that burn wood are plagued by creosote that builds up in chimneys as dangerous as this problem can become , preventing or reducing creosote buildup is not as hard as it seems to be",1.0
here are five ways you can reduce or prevent creosote buildup in your chimneys,1.0
do not forget to inspect your chimneys on a regular basis and clean them even if the creosote only looks like it is in the early stages of buildup,1.0
how does creosote form \?,1.0
"have you ever blown on a mirror or piece of glass so that some of the water vapor from your lungs condenses on the glass \? if so , then you may also know that condensation occurs because the glass is cooler than the air exiting your mouth",1.0
"in a similar way , when hot gas and smoke enter the chimney , they are hotter than the stove pipe if the pipe is not hot enough , then creosote will condense out of the smoke and be deposited in the chimney video first seen on corey binford",1.0
the three degrees of creosote buildup,1.0
"as with many other situations in life , creosote build up may not be especially dangerous at first however , if it is left unchecked , or not taken care of soon enough , it can become a very expensive problem as you review the three degrees of creosote buildup , bear in mind that simply cleaning up the mess is only part of the problem you will still need to take active steps to prevent or at least slow down further creosote buildup",1.0
1st degree,1.0
"just about every chimney will build up layers of soft black material known as soot if you can easily brush the black layer of material out of the chimney , chances are there is actually very little creosote in it",1.0
"many people consider this a good sign because it means the fire is burning hot enough to reduce the amount of temperature difference between the smoke and the chimney while this stage isn t especially dangerous , you will still need to clean out the chimney on a routine basis in order to keep good air flow",1.0
2nd degree,1.0
"at this level , you will start to see more creosote in the soot there will be quite a few shiny black flakes of material that can still be removed if you put some effort into it if you see this kind of soot , it is very important to increase the air flow in the burning area",1.0
3rd degree,1.0
"this type of creosote buildup forms layers of a tar like coating on inner surfaces of the chimney if you think about how cholesterol builds up in arteries , then you have a pretty good picture of what i mean",1.0
"3 rd degree creosote also contains a good bit of unburned fuel as a result , when it does catch fire , it can be quite dangerous the third degree of creosote buildup is caused by cool burning fires with inadequate ventilation , or by a flue that is too large",1.0
here are five ways to resolve this type of buildup you may need a combination of answers in order to reduce the level of creosote buildup as much as possible,1.0
1 keep a robust airflow,1.0
"have you ever lit a candle , and then put it in a glass cup \? if so , then you have also probably seen soot build up on the sides of the glass",1.0
"when a fire burns under any kind of restricted air flow , the soot from the fire will also concentrate and condense into smaller areas typically , fireplaces that have glass doors , or are otherwise closed off will have the most problems with airflow",1.0
"here s what you can do to remedy this problem keep the ash bin and grate area as clean as possible open the damper so that more air gets into the fireplace if you cannot get enough air moving in the fireplace , try using a fan or blower to push more air in through the damper make sure that the fan is made of metal or some other non flammable material aside from purchasing a new model , you may also find some old , or vintage blowers at a flea market for a much lower price never underestimate the power or durability of these old , but incredibly durable blowers and fans ! in some cases , downdrafts from the outside can also cause poor air circulation inside the stove you can try adding a partial cover to the top of outer pipe alternatively , add an insert with an inward curve that will also reduce the amount of downdraft that can get down the chimney",1.0
2 keep the fire hot,1.0
"even though you may think of a piece of wood as a single object , it is actually made up of all kinds of molecules this , in turn , means that some molecules will have a higher kindling point than others",1.0
"if the fire is not hot enough , some of the molecules that require a hotter temperature will escape into the chimney and form a layer of creosote if the conditions are right later on , if the temperature inside the chimney gets hot enough , these particles will catch fire and burn",1.0
"the hotter the fire is , the better chance there is of these molecules being reduced to heat and ash in the fireplace in addition , the hotter the fire is , the hotter the chimney will be when the chimney is hot enough , all the gunk that forms creosote cannot collect",1.0
"here are some ways to increase the heat output from a wood fire add a few handfuls of coal to the wood fire coal burns at a higher temperature and will also last longer without a question , anyone that has used a coal fire on a freezing winter night can tell you just how delightful they are ! install heat retaining bricks in the fireplace this will increase the temperature inside the burn area and help keep the temperature steadier insulate the chimney pipe with bricks this is especially important if you are using a metal chimney , as they will always be cooler on the inner surface the insulation will help , however it will not entirely solve the problem if it is caused by using a metal chimney",1.0
3 check the size of the flue,1.0
consider a situation where you want to heat up a cup of coffee over a campfire chances are it will only take a few minutes to achieve this goal now let s say you want to heat up a gallon of water over the exact same campfire,1.0
"heating up a gallon of water will take longer than a cup because there are more atoms to deal with in a similar way , when the flue is too large , there is simply too much material for the fire to contend with a wood stove should not have a flue larger than six inches",1.0
"when you reduce the size of the flue , it allows less heat to escape some people have noticed a 20 or better increase in heat produced by fireplaces that have an optimally sized flue therefore , you will be reducing creosote problems and get more heat at the same time",1.0
"depending on the construction of the stove and chimney system , you may not be able to simply rip the whole thing out and start over again your best option will be to insert a sleeve into the chimney so that it has a smaller internal diameter even though these sleeves are usually made of metal , the surrounding brick in the chimney should keep it warm enough to reduce the risk of creosote build up if you still get too much creosote , focus on increasing the heat produced by the fire and the amount of air flow going up into the chimney remember , the more air flow you have going up the chimney , the harder it will be for particles to stay still long enough to attach to inner surfaces you may also want to let the wood season longer than a few months , and choose some type of wood other than pine look for wood that has less resin or sap in it it is also very important to stay away from pellets or other types of pre manufactured wood because they may be designed to burn at lower temperatures than what you will need to heat up an over sized chimney",1.0
4 make sure the wood is fully seasoned and dry,1.0
"have you ever tried to start a fire during or after it rains \? if you are camping , chances are you use a number of methods to dry the wood out as much as possible so that it produces more heat than smoke",1.0
"in a similar way , when wood is not fully seasoned and dried out , it will produce more creosote fires that produce a lot of smoke also have the following problems there is less airflow , which reduces the amount of oxygen available to the fire the fire will burn cooler because water impedes combustion smoke is also a sign that more fuel is escaping into the air than you would get from a cleaner burning fire",1.0
there is no substitute for time when it comes to seasoning wood you can try keeping logs closer to the fire place for a few days before you actually burn them just remember to rotate them often so that the log dries out more evenly,1.0
"chopping the log into smaller pieces might help too this will increase surface area , which in turn will speed up water evaporation you will still need to rotate the wood around to ensure the fastest possible drying",1.0
"when it comes to seasoning wood , many people make the mistake of covering the wood with a waterproof , air tight tarp the wood will release water vapor , however it will fall right back onto the wood and be absorbed all over again",1.0
"you will be better served by keeping the wood loosely covered and in a warm , sunny spot while it is drying as with drying the wood out indoors , do not forget to rotate the woodpile every few days so that the pieces dry out as much and as evenly as possible",1.0
"if the weather is especially damp , humid , or rainy , it may be of some help to cut the wood into smaller pieces no matter how you look at it , increasing surface area always speeds up evaporation it may seem like a lot of extra work , however it will pay off when you have hotter fires and fewer problems with creosote",1.0
5 do not overload the stove with wood,1.0
"when you have had a long , hard day , it is tempting to load the stove with as much wood as possible so you won t have to add more through the night on the other side of the equation , when you put too much wood in the stove , it reduces air flow",1.0
"aside from this , when fires burn , they also release some water vapor when there is too much wood in the stove , some of that vapor may just land on the wood and increase its moisture level no matter how well seasoned the wood is , that increased moisture will cause the fire to burn poorly",1.0
"here are some ways to resolve this problem start off by adding just one piece at a time to the fire if the fire burns well , try adding a second piece keep adding more pieces as long as the fire burns cleanly do not forget that you may not be able to add as many pieces at one time on rainy days or ones where it is impossible to prevent a downdraft from the chimney install an automatic wood feeder even thought a wood feeder can take up a good bit of space , it may be a better solution than trying to manually feed the stove use coal and other materials that might burn longer during times when you won t be available to feed the stove more wood",1.0
"wherever you live in \( an apartment or a house \) , chances are the building will have a chimney , and there will also be a stove available for burning wood getting started with wood burning is not especially difficult , but avoiding creosote buildup in the chimney can be challenge",1.0
"be careful about the condition of the fire , the wood , and ventilation issues that may lead to creosote buildup once you find a way to reduce the speed of creosote buildup , do not forget to inspect the chimney on a regular basis",1.0
"a clean chimney is not just a safe one , it is a valuable asset that will help you burn wood efficiently and get the most from it",1.0

"title strange silence of neo con trolls as mikheil saakashvili stabs his patron poroshenko in the back author mark almond text written by mark almond the sudden resignation of mikheil saakashvili as governor of odessa and his accompanying tirade of accusations of corruption and treason against the ukrainian president , petro poroshenko and his coterie in kiev came as a bombshell for the western media on 7th november but it was a strangely bland bombshell yes , the voices of the west the bbc , cnn , the new york times , wall st journal , radio free europe radio liberty mentioned that the former georgian president , who had been brought in to combat corruption in ukraine s key port and one of its major russian speaking cities , had resigned , even that he criticised his patron and old university chum , poroshenko , for being on the take but the reportage has been strangely opaque remember both saakashvili and poroshenko had been routinely characterised as the epitome of anti corruption campaigners by western neo con voices whose echo chamber is the supposedly liberal media , cnn , nbc in the usa and bbc and channel four news in the uk no mention of poroshenko s past service to the notoriously corrupt regimes in ukraine before 2014 is permitted , nor reference to his alleged business dealings with pariahs like iran before he came on board for the regime change of the decade in february , 2014 as for the reality that to most georgians their ex president , president , mikheil saakashvili , was the personification of a brutal , loud mouthed demagogue that too was passed over in silence by those who boast that they tell truth to power from the editorial suites of western newsrooms and newspapers saakashvili s own people remember how it was exactly nine years ago on 7th november , 2007 , that his western equipped para military police smashed demonstrations against him in tbilisi with a mixture of high tech ultra low frequency disorientation weapons and swagger sticks and jackboots the anniversary of lenin s seizure of power ninety nine years ago has strange fascination for saakashvili as his day for decisive coups after his fall from power in georgia four years ago , saakashvili had become a kind of post communist flying dutchman albeit inverted abandoned by his dutch wife after revelations of the crudest kind of tax payer funded infidelities , he roamed the west trying to find sanctuary even the usa quietly but firmly denied him a haven as revelations that underneath his glass fronted police stations much vaunted in the guardian and transitions online as model reforms secret dungeons housed torture and sexual abuse against his opponents have shattered his reputation at home and were known to insiders abroad saakashvili has of course embarrassed his us sponsors before by launching unilateral action without consulting them and getting full permission in advance remember how in august , 2008 , he thought he could overrun south ossetia before russia could react and would earn the plaudits of the neo cons in the west for his courageous leadership instead , he provoked a russian backlash and the disintegration of his army in a grand strategy worthy of mussolini s placement of his best troops in ethiopia before invading greece and libya with badly equipped conscripts , saakashvili had sent his 6 , 000 us trained troops to do garrison duty in iraq for his american sponsors when he decided to provoke russia in 2008 the worthless adventure shattered saakashvili s value to the west less than a year after it had ignored his brutal suppression of opposition and had endorsed yet another rigged presidential election in his favour ousted by even some of his ex cronies after 2012 , it was his old university contemporary , petro poroshenko , who threw a lifeline to the ex georgian president and a slew of his ex enforcers from georgia rather as the old soviet communist party had deployed loyal apparatchiks from outside each republic to enforce the kremlin s will on the multi ethnic population of the ussr , so washington now backed a strategy of parachuting outsiders from other ex soviet republics and of course the children of nazi era emigres from ukraine itself into key positions to control the ukrainian people themselves in case they took it into their heads to take democracy seriously the americans often overlooked the internal contradictions of this parody of comintern tactics saakashvili was notoriously anti armenian in power in georgia , when he bulldozed scores of ancient armenian buildings in tbilisi to make way for his reichstag look alike presidential palace so it wasn t by chance that he got into a brawl with the ethnic armenian interior minister of independent ukraine last year saakashvili s arrival in largely russian speaking odesa was a red rag to the locals they resisted his attempt to massage local elections in favour of his preferred candidates for mayor and so on as he had done back home in georgia he denounced the opposition as corrupt but at best this was the pot calling the kettle black saakashvili s own tarnished reputation went before him across the black sea even if seminars in oxford or harvard took his credentials as mr clean at face value now his wrestling match with the ukrainian mafia and his attempt to impose his own georgian clan in odessa has come into the open the publication of the panama papers was supposed to tarnish vladimir putin but in reality the dirt spewed out of poroshenko for his murky caribbean cash pile just as the revelation of david cameron s family ties to offshore accounts fatally undermined his standing in the run up to the brexit referendum poroshenko s claims to represent westernization for ukraine were not without an ironic plausibility then to compound poroshenko s credibility gap as an anti corruption campaigner , an mp of soros sponsored afghan communist background got a bill passed with american backing requiring politicians and officials to publish declarations of their wealth the published amounts commonly enraged ordinary , poverty stricken ukrainians even if they were often a shadow of the real wealth stashed away by the representatives of the people having come to power by decrying viktor yanukovich s alleged orgy of corruption , the poroshenko crew looked odiously bloated with inexplicable wealth into the scandal stepped the unpopular , alien governor odessa despite being appointed by the president , saakashvili chose to denounce him personally for betraying the ukrainian people , western values and the anti mafia crusade which saakashvili claimed to personify western media express surprise at the ferocity of saakashvili s attacks on the integrity of his old university friend , poroshenko , who had rescued him from exile and given him his new lease of political life in odessa don t these hacks remember how saakashvili had been raised up by georgia s eduard shevardnadze , who became godfather to his prot g s son , eduard , while he was minister of in justice in that cruelly corrupt regime , before saakashvili turned on his patron and ousted him in the so called rose revolution in november , 2003 \? now thirteen unlucky years later , saakashvili has bitten the hand that fed him in ukraine part of the western media s amnesia is of course that until yesterday both saakashvili and poroshenko were portrayed as model reformers , anti corruption campaigners and so on suddenly , one paragon of civic virtue smears the other cnn , bbc and wall st journal can t compute it clearly , no one in the central information agency had distributed the script in advance of this crisis so unlike the well signalled abandonment of a western darling like shevardnadze in 2003 or the preparations for the maidan uprising in 2013 14 then of course , the amanpours et al were on hand with the moniker and mood music to encapsulate the propaganda line yesterday s hero was now a villain but forget about shevardnadze or kuchma , here comes an english speaking motor mouth spewing out all the new world order guff about civil society , anti corruption and , of course , russophobia the saakashvili porodshenko spat not only casts a garish light on the sleazy reality of western backed regime change on either side of the black sea georgia as well as ukraine but more importantly it illustrates the dangerous tailspin into which the casual promotion of corrupt and unstable post soviet politicians as paragons of civic virtue has plunged western policy in eastern europe the recent uptick in sabre rattling by nato reflects the bankruptcy of the political options promoted by the euro atlantic regime changers having toppled and re toppled post communist regimes , promoting and then pulling down successive corrupt and brutal heroes of the street , the west now faces the grim reality that its reputation is as tarnished by this sleazy process as much as its former local heroes maybe one of the youthful najibullahs of kiev will be pushed to fill the void but don t underrate the ability of ukraine s oligarchs to navigate the storms of post communist politics and never ending flow of embarrassing revelations of hypocrisy and corruption which the dnieper can never wash away saakashvili has declared war in a most hobbesian environment on the most powerful and odious characters in the country above all , he has denigrated the president of ukraine himself whose authority cannot survive allowing his former prot g to abuse him with impunity this cannot end well for both men no one should be surprised if saakashvili and poroshenko are suddenly reconciled , but any embrace of these two old comrades from the komsomol can only follow lenin s dictum put your arms around the enemy s shoulders so you get your hands closer to his throat saakashvili may be counting on the americans to save his bacon he seems to have forgotten what president sarkozy told him in august , 2008 the seventh cavalry is not coming over the hill to rescue you ultimately , even the global nation par excellence does not believe that a georgian political clan can takeover ukraine and rule it for washington against the will of the ukraine s own mafias saakashvili s impulsive detonation of this crisis might lead other ukrainians to pose as champions of probity against poroshenko , but the west s international brigade of reformers who failed at home sent in to transform ukraine have had their day some slink back home to the baltic states or chicago , but saakashvili has no homeland anymore with his georgian citizenship revoked , and tbilisi demanding his extradition for a host of alleged crimes in office from 2003 until 2012 , saakashvili has few places to run to remember the usa wouldn t give him permanent residence which was why he jumped at the chance to serve poroshenko s bogus anti corruption but very real anti russian drive in odessa with the boss of bosses backing in kiev , saakashvili could find himself facing extradition back to georgia or even to russia which accused him of genocide for killing so many civilians in his madcap invasion of south ossetia in august , 2008 the west can afford to throw away saakashvili poroshenko and his prime minister , groysman godson of poroshenko s father have been washington s key allies in kiev if they were to fall , or , if fearing washington was about to push them , they jumped ship back to their old comrades in moscow , the neo cons house of cards in eastern europe could collapse maybe the strange silence of the west s normally vocal media analysts about saakashvili s bombshell reflects their bewilderment that the best laid plans for domination in the east are beginning to crumble like one of the stale cookies handed out in kiev by that pin up for regime change , victoria neuland after all the hullaballoo about donald trump being the cat s paw of pro russian interests who had backed viktor yanukovich in the swirling crisis in ukraine three years ago , that none of the hacks decrying his hidden kremlin links have explained how saaki and porky poroshenko fell out so spectacularly or what it means for western grand strategy their silence is very revealing even google s orwellian approach to news management has rarely been so crude the story was a bombshell , headlined with live updates but not anymore amnesia not analysis is increasingly the western media elite s response to the crisis besetting its most cherished policies does this silence imply retreat or will the west lash out after tuesday s us presidential election \? maybe saakashvili s tantrum will set the seventh cavalry in motion , not to rescue him today any more than in 2008 , but to mask the failure of regime change with open war in the east now that is something the western media has been talking about a lot recently reprinted with permission from author 's

"title comment on neoliberalism s border guard by craazyboy author craazyboy text by outis philalithopoulos in the most recent episode of this series , the ghost of outis had fun watching a disney movie afterwards , he spoke with zootopia s star , judy hopps , about the movie s sly humor , and its efficacy at stigmatizing prejudice and fostering empathy for the suffering of others after my visit from judy , i felt reinvigorated , ready to take a fresh look at the questions that had puzzled me i could discern three large scale principles at work in deciding whom to include and whom to exclude from the liberal tent one is postmodernism one is smartness and the third , seen clearly in zootopia , is a consensus about the reality of certain kinds of suffering and trauma during the past few decades , the importance of smartness has if anything increased a college education has become a basic requirement for being middle class , and parents of all political stripes scrabble desperately to get their children into the best schools the credentialing sectors of capitalism have been dominated by liberals for decades , but only recently have we successfully leveraged this strategic asset into the idea that liberals are basically the same as educated people other sites of cultural production hollywood , television , marketing , social media corporations are also stereotypically liberal , and have become much more responsive to pressure from progressives movies like zootopia , watched by millions of parents and children , show how it is possible to direct corporate power toward positive goals we have succeeded in dividing capitalism into two halves , one still ugly and irredeemable , but the other \( the cultural and credentialing sectors \) tamed , dynamic , and fashionable we absorb into our alliance everyone from marketing professionals to college professors to people who just like the daily show , reinforcing our sense of truth by identifying things as stupid , backwards , or insane looking now at the other two principles postmodernism and suffering wendy brown foretold that , as foci , they would be unable to coexist since the time of her prediction , the balance between the two has shifted dramatically , and it has become clear that brown was rooting for the losing side postmodernism lamented the modern world s lack of orienting fixed points , and maybe tried to make a virtue out of this disorientation maybe , as i suggested to foucault , it tried to establish the insistent assertion of the lack of fixed points as its own fixed point , and then covered the maneuver in a bewildering morass of verbiage the contrast with the familiar liberalism of today is stark we have reconstructed ourselves as progressives , burying postmodernism and reconstituting a robust sense of absolute morality and truth the process took some time to gather steam , but is now at the helm of mainstream culture although we believe in some positive ideals like education , we have been especially successful at vanquishing the corrosive doubts of postmodernism by setting up negative ideals as transcendentally true at the center of our imagination are atrocities like slavery , genocide , rape these no one can doubt , these are things to which at one s peril one refuses to kneel who can deny that they exist , that they hurt , that they are evil \? we therefore pick out vivid episodes in which certain groups of people suffered , and make it clear that anyone that does not ritually acknowledge the reality of their suffering is unworthy to be part of society in this way , we manage to stigmatize horrible , regressive behavior , but that isn t enough high profile instances of genocide and torture don t appear every day , and commitment flags without regular stimulation and so we have taken seriously at least one idea from postmodernism , the fascination with slight conceptual nuances , and the faith or fear that these nuances can produce enormously consequential effects we focus not just on torture but also on less obviously brutal but still hurtful behavior \( micro aggressions \) not just on behavior but on language , not just on language but also on thoughts by discouraging hurtful speech and sensitizing people to implicit bias , we make the world a more pleasant place critics of progressives complain about political correctness , but you can t forge a unitary culture without imposing boundaries , and we mainly focus on obvious principles of good manners and consideration toward others zootopia as an allegory although there is still a long way to go , the progress of our culture toward liberation is historically unparalleled zootopia provides an extensive allegory about our achievement we naturally dread the uncivilized past one symbol of the past is the pathetic figure of judy s parents , who tell her to settle and not follow her dreams more frighteningly , the plot of the movie revolves around the mysterious fact that some animals are reverting to wildness the past is thus not merely the past , but threatens to return there is a still more insidious threat , which is the possibility that some part of the past remains lodged inside of us , like the specks of evil that st augustine once believed that god places in us in order to foil our efforts to attain goodness on our own this fear is hardly surprising , given that we have come to a consensus that certain ways of talking that just twenty or even ten years ago passed without comment in liberal circles are , in reality , clearly problematic the climax of zootopia is when judy , without any selfish or cruel intent , loses control of her mouth and primitive , nonprogressive ideas escape from it zootopia doesn t merely show us the shadow of the past , but also offers us , as individuals , hope in the exciting future judy avoids becoming a carrot farmer like her parents , and is able to move past the degrading experience of working as a meter maid by virtue of being impressive , competent , and using the rules in her favor , she is able to rise to the top and be valued for her abilities leftists often worry that professional success can lead to people losing their moral compass zootopia offers a helpful perspective on this dilemma when judy reaches the pinnacle of success , that is precisely when she messes up and says problematic things at first glance , zootopia seems to suggest that morality is far more important than worldly success judy responds to her fault by taking a leave of absence from her job and feeling terrible in the end , she is only able to redeem herself by treating herself as utterly worthless by confessing abjectly to nick , pronouncing herself damned , and handing him the only key that can set her free i now realized , though , that the message of the movie was optimistic true , if we say or think wrong things , we need to respond seriously , the way judy did but if we do that and if we express support for progressive ideals and acknowledge our privilege then we can be as successful as we want to be there doesn t need to be any conflict between ambition and being a good person that doesn t mean that liberals have to care about professional success if you want to care about people in africa or the plight of the working class , that s great , too the important thing is that we come together on the important things , like basic moral principles and recognizing the suffering of marginalized groups as this consensus consolidates , society will continue to progress some people will try to derail the process , maybe due to sensitivity about having been called out , or anger at losing their privilege more and more , those people will be seen as throwbacks demographic forces will render them irrelevant maybe they will just be swept away by globalization or maybe they can work at the dmv the phantom a bell sounded and roused me from my vision of the future there i saw a phantom , draped and hooded , gliding like mist along the ground towards me it was shrouded in a deep , black garment , which concealed its head , its face , its form , and left nothing visible except one outstretched hand the spirit of liberalism yet to come , i presume \? i asked the spirit did not answer i felt a stab of fear at what it might show me would the current positive trajectory continue \? would the future bring cultural progress in ways i couldn t even imagine \? or would the 2020s instead feature a cyclical swing back to postmodernism \? or something worse still \? the spirit merely pointed onward with its hand i followed it , and found myself listening to another speech , taking place not in the far future , but toward the end of 2016 yet my sense of foreboding did not abate , and for apparently no reason at all , the cloud capped towers and gorgeous palaces of my vision suddenly seemed insubstantial , and vain i remain curious why the debate over antiracism as a politics takes such indirect and evasive forms like the analogizing and guilt by association , moralistic bombast in lieu of concrete argument and why it persists in establishing , even often while denying the move , the terms of debate as race vs class he seemed to refer to antiracism as if it were not an obviously good thing i looked at his name plate adolph reed \? who was this person \? in the logic of antiracism , exposure of the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to a recognition of injustice , which will in turn lead to remedial action though not much attentions seems ever given to how this part is supposed to work i suspect this is because the exposure part , which feels so righteously yet undemandingly good , is the real focus i did not understand why the sound of his voice troubled me so much spirit ! i exclaimed , this is a fearful place i will not forget its lessons , trust me let me go ! but the ghost only pointed , with an unmoved finger , at reed , whose icy words burned in my ears these responses show how fundamentally antiracism and other identitarian programs are not only the left wing of neoliberalism but active agencies in its imposition of a notion of the boundaries of the politically thinkable sort of neoliberalism s intellectual and cultural border guard answer me one question , i cried are the things reed says the shadows of things to come , or are they merely his own cynical perspective \? i caught at the spirit s spectral hand it sought to free itself , but i persisted yet the spirit was stronger than i was , and repulsed me i fell to the ground , and when i arose , i was alone in the weeping land the series concludes tomorrow , with outis reaching new conclusions and making an important decision sources adolph reed s remarks are from a recent interview and an earlier article some of the thoughts on political correctness are based on belle waring s crooked timber article 0 0 0 0 0 0",1.0

"how a d h d became an over diagnosed disorder according to the centers for disease control and prevention \( cdc \) , approximately 11 of children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with a d h d as of 2011 however , if you ask the american psychiatric association , they maintain that even though only 5 of american children suffer from the disorder , the diagnosis is actually given to around 15 of american children this number has been steadily rising , jumping from 7 8 in 2003 to 9 5 in 2007 schwarz identifies two main themes involved with a d h d misdiagnosis the pharmaceutical industry s role in pushing a d h d drugs , and doctors failing to identify the root cause of children s behavioural issues",1.0
"in an interview with scientific american , schwarz explains many kids have problems and need help but those problems in many cases will derive from trauma , anxiety , family discord , poor sleep or diet , bullying at school and more we must not abandon them we must help but we must also be more judicious in how we do that , rather than reflexively giving them a diagnosis of what is generally described as a serious , lifelong brain disorder",1.0
"big pharma s role in widespread a d h d misdiagnosis it s no secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry as with many other diseases and disorders , when it comes to a d h d , pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to overstate the dangers of a d h d and the benefits of taking their drugs and understate the negative side effects it s easy for people to believe this misguided information when it s affiliated with well known universities like harvard and johns hopkins many people don t even realize that these studies are funded by the very companies that profit from the drugs sale because that relationship is hidden in small print \( source \) even though many of the advertisements big pharma has released state that a d h d medication is safer than aspirin , these drugs can have significant side effects and are actually considered to be within the same class as morphine and oxycodone due to high risk of abuse and addiction you can t just blame all doctors , either many of them genuinely believe they re helping these children because of the information they ve been given in these studies and by big pharma",1.0
"big pharma creates advertisements for a d h d drugs that are specifically targeted at parents , describing how these drugs can improve test scores and behaviour at home , among other false claims one of the most controversial ones was a 2009 ad for intuniv , shire s a d h d treatment , which included a child in a monster costume taking off his terrifying mask to reveal his calm , smiling self with a text reading , there s a great kid in there the fda has stepped in multiple times , sending pharmaceutical companies warning letters or even forcing them to take down their ads because they are false , misleading , and or exaggerate the effects of their drugs \( source \)",1.0
the following new york times video was created by schwarz and poh si teng,1.0

"what is a d h d and is it even real \? if brain scans are performed on people with a d h d , there are clear structural differences however , the majority of a d h d diagnoses are confirmed by observation , and often not even by a doctor parents or school teachers are typically responsible for observing a child s actions , and if they fit the criteria for a d h d , doctors confirm the diagnosis and hand them a prescription instead of getting to the root of these children s attention deficit , they are told they have a medical condition that can only be fixed with medication this is not only unethical , but also clearly damaging to a child s self esteem many of these kids could simply be uninterested in the subject matter , suffering from some sort of emotional trauma , or even have heightened creativity and energy !",1.0
"many doctors question the legitimacy of a d h d in general and whether or not it should be classified as a mental disorder this is largely because the definition of this and similar disorders is usually heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry american psychologist lisa cosgrove and others investigated financial ties between the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders \( dsm \) panel members and the pharmaceutical industry their findings showed that , of the 170 dsm panel members , 95 \( 56 \) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry and 100 of the members of the panels on mood disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders had financial ties to drug companies \( read our article about it here \)",1.0
"neurologist richard saul spent his career examining patients who struggle with short attention spans and difficulty focusing his extensive experience has led him to believe that a d h d isn t actually a disorder , but rather an umbrella of symptoms that shouldn t be considered a disease thus , saul believes it shouldn t be listed as a separate disorder in the american psychiatric association s diagnostic statistical manual you can read more about his opinion in our article here",1.0
"no matter what your stance on a d h d is , it is clear that too many children are being diagnosed with it and handed prescriptions without proper medical evaluations if you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with a d h d , i suggest you do your own research on the subject instead of simply taking drugs for a mental disorder that may have been falsely diagnosed",1.0

"in a video released by project veritas , james o keefe exposes what everyone except democrats have known to be true there is a lot of voter fraud",1.0
"in the video , nyc democratic commissioner of the board of elections alan schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a united federation of teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in new york city",1.0
"yeah , they should ask for your id i think there is a lot of voter fraud , said schulkin , who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in new york",1.0
"voter fraud has been labeled as a right wing myth by the left , but schulkin , a democrat , confirmed everyone s worst fears , going against the grain of his own party",1.0
"you know , i don t think it s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an id like i say , people don t realize , certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote , said schulkin",1.0
"when asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in , schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods , adding , they get busses and they move people around",1.0
schulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that mayor bill de blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in new york city,1.0
"he gave out id cards de blasio that s in lieu of a driver s license , but you can use it for anything but , they didn t vet people to see who they really are anybody can go in there and say i am joe smith , i want an id card it s absurd there s a lot of fraud not just voter fraud , all kinds of fraud",1.0
"despite having disapproval with de blasio s faulty id program and widespread voter fraud , schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud , specifically with regards to muslims wearing burkas",1.0
"they detonate bombs in the public schools , which we are using that could disrupt the whole election your vote doesn t even count , because they can go in there with a burka and you don t know if they are a voter",1.0
it is clear after listening to a new york city democratic election commissioner that the democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them schulkin confirms that voter id laws are something that new york city desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud,1.0

"title awakened humanity awaits fully scripted ending as controversial election day nears author bernie suarez text in consciousness , government corruption , society , special interests , us news no event in american history \( if you ask me \) has been more engineered , more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming november 8 , 2016 presidential election face it this presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream evil and corruption was brought into the light we ve observed what a george soros like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside , our side this time we had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the us overthrew with their democracy tactics using special forces , ngo s , paid for revolutionaries , activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters \( isis , moderate rebels \) this time the engineered chaos was happening here in the us this 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption , lies , propaganda , murders , stolen primaries , fabricated accusations , distractions , staged debates and much more we have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from parkinson s disease , passing out , having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector this is the stuff hollywood films are made of the list of the insanity goes on and on , right \? we ve witnessed plenty of lies , propaganda and jerry springer show like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that americans are not looking into the events in aleppo or mosul much less the hillary dnc mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the us criminal empire , the elite relied on a very in your face and increasingly arrogant , defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can actually , this understates the situation what really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs \( hillary \) and together their campaign \( the dnc hillary soros moveon org michael moore hollywood mainstream media complex \) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation actually , i m understating the situation again all or most americans \( awakened or not \) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the us presidential elections the question we should all be asking then is , how did we get here \? oh , and perhaps more importantly , where are we going \? and to answer this , one must realize that the ruling elite have plans they have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans not sure of this \? then please research sandy hook or boston bombing events or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years that s right while they were staging one event after another , too many americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were too many americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media stories and narratives unless we could prove that the account didn t happen the way mainstream media said it did in other words , many americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise , we should believe mainstream media well here we are in october of 2016 and finally \( though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while \) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone no longer can it be considered a conspiracy by anyone , that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite that said , now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 us presidential election will staged political terrorism , a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the american psyche , be staged as mike adams at natural news is writing about \? will this terrorism or planned event mark the beginning of the end of america \? if so , what will happen \? how will it all go down \? many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy america \? the one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many events of the past several years have been scripted and planned so today i invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today s events the fact that they are planned the notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate they hate anything that is organic , spontaneous , unpredictable , people powered , natural and real they need everything to be controlled , scripted , planned , orchestrated , engineered do you see a pattern here \? one consciousness longs for freedom , naturalness and spontaneity , the other longs to control , orchestrate , engineer and dictate the ending , like a master would want to control his slave understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness \( think ruling elite \) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free , will allow you to see what s coming this november 8th 2016 what s coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of so the real question is , will their operation succeed \? looking at the election day ending from a birds eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment in this \( what i ll call \) wait and see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction based plan to be determined by the emerging reality , we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan in other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking this ultimately is all we need to know to plan our \( truth seekers and freedom lovers \) next move and our next move should look something like this if you ask me 1 have a plan including options for self sustaining yourself and your loved ones \( food , water , shelter and other personal needs \) 2 expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators let s not let one of these traitors \( including crisis actors and operatives working for the state \) get away with what they have done 3 don t rely only on the internet to keep track of developing events you might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents \( proof \) also download important videos don t assume these videos will always be available on youtube or the internet remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age the main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed america and humanity 4 beware of layered psychological operations question everything you hear and don t discount that some news is designed for you to hear it \( get it \? \) unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war in deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are , especially as we see the hillary mainstream media complex laughably blaming russian president vladimir putin for all the now revealed corruption and criminality of the clintons , the mainstream media , the dnc and many others now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies , lightness versus darkness , freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge \( the occult \) because this , my friends , is what we are dealing with we \( truth seekers \) are all in this together we didn t ask to be put in this show , it sort of came to us perhaps we \( awakened humanity \) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand this species we call humans needs some members of it s kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity there is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted we \( like them \) will also respond in real time in the most effective way possible what we need to do more than anything else is \( pay attention \) think ahead just like they do and so today i m thinking ahead i have plans for both scenarios \( trump or hillary declared victory \) i have plans for no political terrorism and political terrorism , shock or no shock , chaos or no chaos in my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite , their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption plain and simple , the ruling elite must be identified , stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the us constitution this is more important than any presidential election will a trump victory make this accountability more possible \? many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us finally , i m reminded of the very last line of the film the american dream when the villain asks what do you think this is \? and the answer this is america ! ! likewise , let s remember , this is america , the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the us constitution will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way \? that question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night this is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day submit your review",1.0

"for those who were hoping or dreading the continued presence of crazy joe biden in a presidential administration after the barack obamas belatedly leave the white house , the loose lipped 73 year old has confirmed that the nation won t have joe biden to kick around any more",1.0
"biden , who was rumored to be on hillary clinton s short list for secretary of state and prior to that was being groomed as a late contender for the democratic party nomination in the event clinton failed to carry california in the primary , told a minnesota radio station friday he has no intention of serving in hillary clinton s administration as secretary of state or in any other role",1.0

title washington war party urges obama to go to war against assad the russians christoph germann author nan text washington war party urges obama to go to war against assad the russians,1.0
clinton fans call on obama to save aleppo as nato gcc backed rebels prepare new offensive originally appeared at newsbud,1.0
"on october 21 , the washington post published a noteworthy op ed titled bring syria s assad and his backers to account now , written by retired u s marine general john allen and self proclaimed syria expert charles lister allen is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and serves on the board of advisors of the washington institute for near east policy \( winep \) , an american israel public affairs committee \( aipac \) cutout the retired four star general attracted a lot of attention earlier this year when he delivered a forceful endorsement of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton at the democratic national convention",1.0
"lister was formerly a visiting fellow at the brookings doha center in qatar and is now a senior fellow at the washington , d c based middle east institute , which describes itself as an unbiased source of information and analysis on the middle east and partners with corporations such as northrop grumman , raytheon , chevron , exxonmobil and saudi aramco lister has dismissed conflict of interest allegations by saying his contact with the syrian opposition had absolutely nothing to do with qatar and stressing that his work on this is 100 funded by western govts 1",1.0
"allen and lister harshly criticize u s inaction in syria in their october 21 op ed , emphasizing that the assad clique and its backers must be brought to account before it is too late",1.0
the authors case rests on the premise that u s policy in syria has been characterized by inaction and has never sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground 2,1.0
"since the beginning of the conflict , advocates of greater u s military involvement have tried to promote the myth of u s inaction in syria",1.0
"even after u s media disclosed the existence of a cia weapons supply and training program in summer 2012 , efforts to promote this myth continued unabated",1.0
"in early 2013 , about eight months after the washington post first reported that the united states is coordinating the flow of weapons to the so called syrian rebels , 3 the editorial board of the washington post warned of the consequences of u s inaction in syria , accusing the obama administration of not doing enough to support the rebels 4",1.0
"neither the washington post nor any other major media outlet in the united states has been willing to publicize the true extent of u s covert operations in syria , which started as early as april may 2011 5",1.0
"from the very beginning , u s policy sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground in favor of the foreign backed anti assad opposition but instead of exposing the u s led war on syria , the media has been feeding into the false narrative of u s inaction in syria",1.0
"referring to this narrative , allen and lister call for accelerating and broadening the provision of lethal and nonlethal assistance to vetted moderate opposition groups 6",1.0
the united states vetting process of militias plays a central role in all of lister s policy proposals 7 what lister fails to mention is that this vetting process consists of nothing more than trace searches in old databases and half hearted interviews u s special forces soldiers on the ground in turkey and jordan told sofrep that many rebels had sympathies with terrorist groups but knew exactly how to sell themselves during such interviews 8,1.0
"as u s special forces soldiers on the ground voice their indignation over a mission that nobody believes in because they are just training the next generation of jihadis , allen and lister want to increase u s assistance to vetted groups in order to save aleppo , which has become the focal point of the syrian conflict",1.0
"for a start , the united states must save aleppo damascus , moscow and tehran are razing the city to prepare for an eventual ground assault as both the cia and pentagon have concluded , an opposition loss in aleppo would severely undermine the united states counterterrorism objectives in syria the city s symbolism and strategic value are unmatched , and allowing it to fall would dramatically empower extremist narratives groups linked to al qaeda would reap the rewards of our shortcomings 9",1.0
"at the beginning of october , just hours after the u s suspended talks with russia over syria , the washington post reported that the cia and the joint chiefs of staff are pressuring president obama to approve kinetic actions against syrian government forces , arguing that an opposition loss in aleppo would undermine america s counterterrorism goals in syria 10",1.0
"given the fact that the opposition in rebel held eastern aleppo is led by jabhat al nusra , this argument seems rather dubious 11 despite rebranding itself as jabhat fatah al sham and supposedly cutting its ties with al qaeda , the group is still considered a terrorist organization by the united states and the united nations another group present in eastern aleppo , ahrar al sham , is also closely tied to al qaeda 12",1.0
it is not exactly clear why groups linked to al qaeda would reap the rewards if groups linked to al qaeda are defeated in eastern aleppo or why their defeat would severely undermine the united states counterterrorism objectives in syria,1.0
"if allen and lister want to stop empowering extremist narratives , they could start by revising their portrayal of the battle of aleppo and the syrian conflict in general",1.0
"nusra and its allies are not defending civilians in eastern aleppo , as frequently claimed , but holding them hostage in order to maintain a foothold in the strategic city , which was invaded by rebels in summer 2012 after refusing to join the uprising",1.0
"as soon as syrian government forces and their allies first managed to encircle the rebel held areas of aleppo in july of this year , they announced the opening of humanitarian passages for civilians and surrendering fighters according to the pro opposition syrian observatory for human rights \( sohr \) , only around 12 people managed to use the bustan al qasr corridor before rebel groups reinforced security measures and prevented families from approaching the corridors 13",1.0
"instead of telling the rebel groups in eastern aleppo to stop holding civilians hostage , the united states and its allies supported a major offensive led and organized by al nusra to break the siege and put some pressure back on russia and iran",1.0
"one western diplomat tried to play down the outside support , saying",1.0
"the rebels problem has never been a lack of weapons this was internally planned , and it succeeded not because of outside support but because fatah al sham and the other jihadi groups are incredibly disciplined , with plenty of guys willing to blow themselves up at the front 14",1.0
"nusra , ahrar al sham and other involved groups referred to the aleppo offensive as the ibrahim al youssef battle , a reference to the syrian army officer who led the aleppo artillery school massacre in the late 1970s",1.0
"in june 1979 , ibrahim al youssef and members of a muslim brotherhood splinter group killed dozens of alawite cadets after separating them from their sunni colleagues during the july august aleppo offensive , a spokesman for the nusra led forces said they would continue what ibrahim al youssef had started and kill the alawites 15",1.0
"ibrahim al youssef s son yasser is a political representative for the u s vetted rebel group harakat nour al din al zinki , which participates in the battle of aleppo and lately joined the nusra led military alliance jaish al fatah zinki is probably best known for beheading a child captive on camera the group reportedly lost u s backing in august or september of last year and was in talks with the u s over the restoration of its support when the incriminating footage emerged 16",1.0
"yasser al youssef has become the media s go to guy for information about the rebels in and around aleppo after the syrian government and its russian allies recently announced a unilateral cease fire to allow civilians and surrendering fighters once again to leave eastern aleppo , agence france presse \( afp \) quoted yasser al youssef as saying that opposition fighters wanted nothing to do with the russian initiative and asking who are they to decide to displace the syrian people who rebelled against the dictator assad \? 17",1.0
"meanwhile , the associated press \( ap \) quoted zinki s al youssef as saying that the opposition had agreed to the initiative to evacuate wounded and allow in aid according to al youssef , the evacuations didn t materialize because the syrian government and russia gave no assurances the wounded would not face arrest 18",1.0
"as both sides were blaming each other for the breakdown , western journalists on the ground confirmed that rebels were firing on the checkpoints and exit corridors , making it extremely dangerous for anyone to leave eastern aleppo 19",1.0
"when allen and lister say the united states must save aleppo , they are not referring to the civilians in eastern aleppo who are being held hostage by the rebels or to the civilians in western aleppo who are being killed by indiscriminate rebel shelling they are referring to al nusra , ahrar al sham , zinki and other rebel groups in eastern aleppo",1.0
"on the same day the allen lister op ed was published , lister gleefully announced on twitter that ahrar al sham , zinki and allied militias are preparing another offensive to break the siege of aleppo nusra will of course join the fight , but the impetus and most of the planning for this offensive largely excluded the terrorist group , as the pr disaster during the july august offensive is still fresh on everyone s mind regional states have provided substantial support to buttress the offensive , according to lister 20",1.0
"u s allies turkey , saudi arabia and qatar already provided substantial support to buttress the july august aleppo offensive with the full blessing of the united states 21 washington s primary objective was to put some pressure back on russia and iran , not to save civilians as before , the new offensive is going to prompt an adequate response from russia and its allies , thereby prolonging the suffering of civilians in aleppo",1.0
"with current u s policy leading nowhere , the obama administration is divided over syria whereas the hawks around cia director john brennan and defense secretary ashton carter want to escalate the conflict , president obama and secretary of state john kerry are increasingly skeptical of such plans",1.0
obama is reportedly not willing to approve plans to supply cia vetted militias with more powerful weapons,1.0
"one senior u s official told the washington post that cia backed units are not doing any better on the battlefield , they re up against a more formidable adversary , and they re increasingly dominated by extremists , raising the question of whether the program can accomplish anything beyond adding to the carnage in syria 22",1.0
the lister approved vetting process is apparently not working,1.0
"moreover , the sceptics in the administration fear that the new weaponry could end up killing russian military personnel and they want to avoid risking a confrontation with russia",1.0
but not everyone shares this opinion,1.0
"due to his reluctance to escalate the conflict in syria , obama has alienated washington s foreign policy establishment , which favors more u s military action , including cruise missile strikes on syrian government forces 23",1.0
that is also a key point of the allen lister plan,1.0
"when the washington post first reported on u s plans to target syrian government forces , russian defense ministry spokesman major general igor konashenkov stressed that russian troops were now widely deployed across syria , implying that any such attack would run the risk of killing russian soldiers 24",1.0
"allen and lister are of course aware of this risk explaining how to punish cease fire violations by syrian government forces with u s military action , they note in passing",1.0
"we should expect the possible intentional co mingling of syrian and russian forces and assets as a deterrent while this may complicate targeting strategies , we should not miss the opportunity to hit offending syrian elements and units , while sustaining counter islamic state operations elsewhere 25",1.0
"neither allen and lister nor washington s foreign policy elite seem to mind risking a direct military confrontation with russia but president obama and other sceptics in the administration don t want to start world war iii over syria , as one senior administration official who is involved in middle east policy emphasized",1.0
you can t pretend you can go to war against assad and not go to war against the russians 26,1.0
"while the war party in washington is waiting for obama to leave office , russia is preparing for a showdown in syria with the largest surface deployment since the end of the cold war 27",1.0
"as allen and lister point out , the war party cannot wait for a new administration in washington because events are moving too quickly 28 they may have lost aleppo by the time hillary clinton takes office 28",1.0
"so obama might have to deal with more accidents , such as the september 17 deir ezzor attack , during his last months as president of the united states did you enjoy this article \? consider helping us ! russia insider depends on your donations the more you give , the more we can do 1 10 other amount",1.0

but i also know him well enough to know that he does want to be involved in what flavor our cake is going to be and what flowers he thinks are ugly and what flowers he thinks are really pretty,1.0
but tmz is now saying that it was all a ruse that johnson was talking a good game about plans for a wedding that had already happened in secret,1.0
"according to tmz 's report , phelps and johnson actually tied the knot in arizona on june 13th , after obtaining a marriage license just a few days prior",1.0
"johnson posted a rather unassuming photo that day a photo posted by nicole michele johnson \( nicole m johnson \) on jun 13 , 2016 at 10 43pm pdt",1.0
"despite that , as recently as four weeks ago , phelps was still playing along a photo posted by michael phelps \( m phelps00 \) on aug 28 , 2016 at 11 28pm pdt",1.0

"title nra elect senators to save u s from un arms trade treaty author joe wolverton , ii , j d text email",1.0
"on november 4 , the national rifle association \( nra \) called on americans concerned about the future of the right to keep and bear arms to focus their attention on electing pro second amendment senators in the upcoming federal elections",1.0
"these senators , the nra explains , will be the last obstacle standing between the united nation 's arms trade treaty 's \( att \) forced civilian disarmament and the continuation of gun rights in america but that s just the beginning as you know , the u s senate also ratifies international treaties right now , at the united nations , the arms trade treaty which could subject american gun owners to international gun registration , monitoring and global gun control norms that would be defined on the fly is just waiting , like unexploded ordnance , for an anti gun u s senate to call it in under president obama , secretary of state john kerry signed onto the arms trade treaty all the treaty needs to become the law of the land is for the u s senate to ratify it",1.0
"while it is certainly wise to fill the senate \( and the house , for that matter \) with representatives committed to upholding the constitution , there are other , surer and more constitutionally sound ways of blocking the unconstitutional confiscation of weapons and ammunition that would be carried out should the un 's arms trade treaty by enforced in the united states",1.0
the most powerful check citizens of the states have on the seizure of weapons by the un or its american allies is the nullification of any and all unconstitutional acts of the federal government,1.0
"nullification is the exercise by states of their retained authority to hold as null , void , and of no legal effect any act of the federal government that exceeds its constitutionally enumerated powers this availability of this tactic is proclaimed and protected by the 10th amendment to the u s constitution",1.0
"the nra is correct , though , that the att is so offensive to the preservation of the right to keep and bear arms that it is an understatement to call it unconstitutional as the new american has reported , several provisions of this treaty significantly diminish the scope of this basic right",1.0
"first , the arms trade treaty grants a monopoly over all weaponry in the hands of the very entity \( government \) responsible for over 300 million murders in the 20th century",1.0
"furthermore , the treaty leaves private citizens powerless to oppose future slaughters",1.0
an irrefutable fact of armed violence unaddressed by the un in its gun grab is that all the murders committed by all the serial killers in history do n't amount to a fraction of the brutal killings committed by authorized state parties using the very weapons over which they will exercise absolute control under the terms of the arms trade treaty,1.0
"article 2 of the treaty defines the scope of the treaty s prohibitions the right to own , buy , sell , trade , or transfer all means of armed resistance , including handguns , is denied to civilians by this section of the arms trade treaty",1.0
"article 3 places the ammunition munitions fired , launched or delivered by the conventional arms covered under article 2 within the scope of the treaty s prohibitions , as well",1.0
"article 4 rounds out the regulations , also placing all parts and components of weapons within the scheme",1.0
"perhaps the most immediate threat to the rights of gun owners in the arms trade treaty is found in article 5 under the title of general implementation , article 5 mandates that all countries participating in the treaty shall establish and maintain a national control system , including a national control list",1.0
this list should apply the provisions of this treaty to the broadest range of conventional arms,1.0
"article 12 adds to the record keeping requirement , mandating that the list include the quantity , value , model type , authorized international transfers of conventional arms , as well as the identity of the end users of these items",1.0
"in very clear terms , ratification of the arms trade treaty by the united states would require that the u s government force gun owners to add their names to the national registry citizens would be required to report the amount and type of all firearms and ammunition they possess",1.0
section 4 of article 12 of the treaty requires that the list be kept for at least 10 years,1.0
"finally , the agreement demands that national governments take appropriate measures to enforce the terms of the treaty , including civilian disarmament if these countries can t get this done on their own , however , article 16 provides for un assistance , specifically including help with the enforcement of stockpile management , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes",1.0
"in fact , a voluntary trust fund will be established to assist those countries that need help from un peacekeepers or other regional forces to disarm their citizens",1.0
"there is no way that the men and women of the united states can hope to maintain their hard won liberty liberty that cost the lives , fortunes , and sacred honor of some of the greatest men of the 18th century without the ability to put up an armed resistance to tyrants and to their armed enforcers",1.0
"the truth is , though , the senate in collusion with the president and the supreme court has shrunk the scope of the second amendment despite the fact that the plain language of the second amendment explicitly forbids any infringement on this right that protects all others",1.0
"in fact , the reason for inclusion of the second amendment in the bill of rights had little to do with the british and more to do with future attempts by an out of control , all powerful central authority disarming the american people as a step toward tyranny",1.0
"take , for example , statements by our forefathers regarding the purpose of the passage of this amendment in commenting on the constitution in 1833 , joseph story wrote the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered , as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally , even if these are successful in the first instance , enable the people to resist and triumph over them",1.0
"in his own commentary on the works of the influential jurist blackstone , founding era legal scholar st george tucker wrote this may be considered as the true palladium of liberty the right of self defense is the first law of nature in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible wherever standing armies are kept up , and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is , under any color or pretext whatsoever , prohibited , liberty , if not already annihilated , is on the brink of destruction",1.0
"writing in the federalist , alexander hamilton explained if the representatives of the people betray their constituents , there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government , and which against the usurpations of the national rulers , may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state",1.0

"posted by matthew bernstein nov 2 , 2016 american strength washington , not russia , was responsible !",1.0
"if you are been paying attention to what the democrats are saying this election in terms of the hacks , they will tell you that it s all part of a plot that involves donald trump and russia every top democrat from hillary clinton to barack obama has argued that",1.0
"they have been saying this ever since the first hacks on the democratic national committee happened back in july and they have continued that claim with every hack that has happened since most recently they have been saying that the hacks on clinton s campaign chairman , john podesta , were part of yet another russian hack",1.0
they have claimed that the hacks were done in order to influence the election in favor of trump not everyone believes that lie in fact there are people out there that think that the source of the hack has come from the united states government,1.0
one person that believes that is former british ambassador craig murray he says that the source of the podesta leaks was a washington insider rather than someone from russia that would mean that clinton s campaign is continuing to make a false claim on a foreign country !,1.0
"murray told sputnik , the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adam s whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow",1.0
that means that there is someone in washington that is doing what he or she can to end the corruption of the clintons and yet her camp continues to claim that someone within russia did it because that is a phenomenal way to create peace between two nations that have nuclear weapons someone in washington is trying to make sure hillary doesn t win,1.0
but that wasn t the only thing that murray went on to destroy he went on to blast the democrats other narrative that wikileaks is a source for russia he has said that such claims are designed to divert attention from the content of the material that means that they are hiding something if they are spending this much time trying to change the story,1.0
"wikileaks also decided to mock the clinton campaign s literal obsession with conspiracy theories with a tweet they said , no link between trump russia no link between assange russia but podesta clinton involved in selling 20 of us uranium to russia",1.0
"this tweet was in reference to the fact that the fbi found nothing of substance that connected donald trump to russia they literally said that he had no clear link to russia so once again , the democrats attempt to say something like that is proven false",1.0
"that also means that if the democrats continue to blame trump for this supposed russian hack on their servers , then they are definitely hiding something because the fbi has cleared trump of any connection to russia and now there is a former british ambassador that has said that the hacks were coming from someone located in washington",1.0
"and there are other claims to back that up there was a youtube video that was released and has gone viral in it , former deputy assistant secretary of state steve pieczenik is talking about how there are people in the united states government are doing what they can to prevent clinton from becoming president of the united states",1.0
"he has said that members of the united states government , including the fbi and the cia , have initiated a counter coup through julian assange and wikileaks in order to stop hillary clinton from becoming president of the united states pieczenik has also said that assange has released emails that we gave to him in order to undermine hillary and bill clinton",1.0
that is two former high ranking members of their respective governments saying that the leak has come from washington and not russia like the democrats want you to believe but it goes even further than that what murray has said is true they are doing whatever they can to have the people of the united states not look at those emails that were released the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks because that is a great foreign policy tactic,1.0
"that is because those emails have shown that the democrats are engaging in some highly illegal activity from all the leaks that we have seen , the democrats have engaged in election rigging , pay to play operations , and cheating in several different debates but of course when you try and confront them on this , they will attempt to say that russia was behind it or that trump was behind it",1.0
"one of the excuses that they have also given has come from interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile during the second hack of the dnc back in july she attempted to scare people from reading the hacked emails by saying that they could possibly be infected with malware really \? if you are making this big an attempt to stop people from reading them , then you are obviously hiding something !",1.0
"of course brazile was mentioned in those wikileaks emails as well she was guilty of giving clinton a question that was going to appear in a town hall and when someone called her out on it , brazile attempted to say that she was being persecuted it s not persecution if the answer is right in front of you ! you were literally doing what you could to help out clinton as much as possible",1.0
share this article to show that there are people out there that believe that the hacks on the democratic party are coming from washington itself rather than russia and considering that the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks means that they are just damaging the foreign relationships even more,1.0
that is not something that the united states can afford anymore we need people that are going to work on making our relationships with foreign governments better not worse we also need people that are going to lead the people and not have to answer to more corruption charges this is why we need donald trump,1.0
title what was the halloween death smog disaster \? and other scary questions and answers about fluoridation author nan text license dmca,1.0
1 why do some people object to water fluoridation \? does n't fluoride occur in the water naturally anyway \?,1.0
"the fluoride products used in water fluoridation \( sodium fluoride or fluorosilicic acid \) are classified as hazardous waste products of the fertilizer , aluminum , and nuclear industries they are even more toxic than naturally occurring fluoride , since they contain other components , such as arsenic and lead",1.0
"however , even naturally occurring fluoride , in areas with high concentrations \( over 1 ppm \) have been found to have extremely adverse health effects even before additional fluoride is added , the level of natural fluoride in the water in many areas in the u s is already equal to the amount of naturally occurring fluoride that has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis in other countries studies done in india and china found skeletal fluorosis in areas containing naturally occurring fluoride as low as 07 ppm \( gupta r , kumar an , bandhu s , gupta s \( 2007 \) skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis scandanavian journal of rheumatology 36 \( 2 \) 154 5 \) that same amount , 07 pmm is the current amount recommended by the cdc to be added to community water supplies",1.0
"in addition to the natural fluoride in groundwater , most people are exposed to multiple sources of fluoride \( pesticides in wine and food , tea , some ceramics , anti depressants , pollution from manufacturing , soft drinks , teflon pans , toothpaste etc \) they presumably are being exposed to well over the equivalent of 1 ppm before any fluoride is added to the water , however no industry or government testing has ever been done to find out how much fluoride the public is absorbing from all sources this massive exposure to fluoride did not exist in the 1950 's , when fluoride was first introduced",1.0
2 do n't all advanced countries fluoridate their water \? and has n't it been proven that countries that do fluoridate their water have better dental health than countries that do n't \?,1.0
"no fluoridation has been almost completely abolished in europe recently other countries , such as israel and many parts of australia , have discontinued fluoridation statistics gathered by the world health organization do not show any difference in rates of dental caries in fluoridated vs non fluoridated countries \( who collaborating center for education , training , and research in oral health , malmo univ , sweden , 2012 \) where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities like canada , the former east germany , cuba and finland , dental decay has not increased but rather has continued to decrease \( maupome' 2001 kunzel fischer , 1997 , 2000 kunzel 2000 seppa 2000 \)",1.0
"in the u s , the state of kentucky , which has been fluoridating the longest , and has achieved almost complete fluoridation of its water supply , has the worst dental health of any state in the country from an article appearing in the lexington herald leader \( 10 14 2009 \) governor beshear said kentucky led the nation in 2004 in terms of the number of people age 65 or older who had lost teeth about 27 percent of kentuckians of all ages had lost six or more teeth to decay or gum disease , compared with 18 percent in the rest of the nation and yet , in 2004 , 99 6 of kentucky 's public water systems were providing fluoridated water to their customers this ranked kentucky first among all states \( kentucky epidemiologic notes and reports , vol 40 no 8 , dept of public health \) advertisement",1.0
"similar results were reported in texas after 9 years and 3 million of adding fluoride , research shows tooth decay has n't dropped among the poorest of bexar county 's children , it has only increased up 13 percent this year \( conger j , 2011 , san antonio added to our drinking water a chemical 'more toxic than lead \? ' kens 5 news \)",1.0
"for the best article analyzing the research on fluoridation worldwide , see the article by john colquhoun , dds , phd \( former chief dental officer of auckland , nz \) why i changed my mind about water fluoridation \( perspectives in biology and medicine 41 29 44 1997 , university of chicago press \) colquhoun studied the effects of fluoridation around the world , with the intention of proving how beneficial it was , but discovered , to his astonishment , that people in countries using fluoridation had the worst teeth he then began crusading to put an end to the practice",1.0
"since 1990 , 144 cities have rejected water fluoridation",1.0
3 where did the idea of fluoridating the water come from \?,1.0
"industrialists in the aluminum and nuclear industries were under fire because of the harmful effects of the fluoride waste products being emitted from their plants animals and people were being sickened for miles around they hired edward bernays , who was the inventor of mass public relations campaigns \( bernays also happened to be the nephew of sigmund freud \) to convince the american people that putting toxic waste in our water supply was good for us advertisement",1.0
"bernays had organized a successful campaign , on behalf of lucky strike cigarettes , to convince american women that smoking was both glamorous and liberating he hired models to pose as debutantes in a march for women 's rights when bernays gave the signal , all the women lit up their cigarettes another successful propaganda campaign that he orchestrated was the overthrow of a democratically elected government in guatemala on behalf of the united fruit company the nazis studied and made use of bernays' techniques for their propaganda programs \( a more in depth discussion of bernays' role in the campaign to convince the public to accept fluoridation can be found in the video the fluoride deception at youtube com , and the book with the same name by christopher bryson , seven stories press \)",1.0
"4 ok , so maybe fluoridation has n't been proven to be effective in improving dental health , but what harm can it do to add it to our water supply \?",1.0
"first there is the cost factor at a time when there is no money for schools , dental treatment for kids , support for the homeless and basic community services , counties are spending millions of dollars to fluoridate the water even worse , fluoridation has been associated with increased rates of kidney disease , alzheimer 's , bone cancer , damage to the thyroid , increased bone fractures , hyperactivity , and decreased iq in children \( see http www robertgammal com pdfs scifactsfluoride pdf \)",1.0
"although adding hazardous waste to our water is not beneficial to anyone , it is particularly harmful to people with kidney disease \( who ca n't excrete it properly \) , infants \( when mixed with formula it far exceeds the safe amount of fluoride \) , farmworkers \( already exposed to fluoride in pesticides \) , tea drinkers , people taking anti depressants , people with low thyroid , and those who have chemical sensitivities also adversely affected would be people who drink lots of water such as diabetics , athletes , and manual laborers",1.0

"title i lived in a 38 person co op in san francisco , and so can you author nan text i lived in a 38 person co op in san francisco , and so can you the joy and practice of learning to share by tommy alexander thebolditalic com community living is blossoming in 21st century san francisco this trend exists at the confluence of diverse historical narratives the free love and experimental ethos of the hippie movement , the casual opulence of the city s victorian era homes and the earnest audacity of start up culture these are co ops where programmers and cooks rub shoulders with artists and teachers , where the phrase love and gratitude is used as a casual valediction , and where globally minded innovators are working to develop replicable models for urban shared living i live in a 13 person co op in a big old house near the apex of ashbury street up here in the fog between the hills and the sky , we are sharing a fundamental human experience a sense of belonging and collaborative meaning making that can be difficult to find in modern urban society these choices may seem unconventional , but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful , creative and affordable existence amid the hectic , electric bustle of our context my housemates and i share food , resources and vision we cook together we clean together and we meet regularly to discuss our mutual stake in this community some of us work nine to five office jobs some of us work on nights and weekends and others work primarily from home so we use slack , the messaging app , to stay on the same page we keep records of logistical information on a google drive , and we manage our common pool funds in a shared bank account we make group decisions using a combination of consensus and do ocracy there are jams and sharing circles as well as neighborhood focused events , potlucks , talks and the occasional party and we must communicate thoughtfully with each other to make sure that everyone s needs are met these choices may seem unconventional , but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful , creative and affordable existence amid the hectic , electric bustle of our context i m aware that the concept of communal living carries cultural baggage when i speak to friends and family who haven t experienced anything quite like this , they invariably draw comparisons to communes and college dorms those are communities , too , but the vast spectrum of human collectivism is far more multifaceted than these few common examples might imply it is natural to process new phenomena in terms of what we know , but it is also important to understand that each community is a unique collection of individuals i ve met a great many bright , passionate and reasonable people who have elected to pool resources with each other , and it looks a little bit different each time there is no singular type of person that benefits most from shared living each day , i awoke with a visceral sense of belonging as for me , i arrived in san francisco in june of 2015 i had just landed my first full time writing job out of college i grew up in hot , flat san jose in the sprawling , suburban shadow of the city , and some yearning part of me had always identified more with the foggy peninsula than the sunny valley i was coming here alone , and i knew that i wanted to move in with a group of people i answered a craigslist ad , filled out an online application and underwent a series of casual phone interviews and there i was on the doorstep of a 24 person co op that spanned the lower two floors of a four story walk up on the north side of alamo square for the first few weeks , i felt that my social capacity was being worn down to a nub there were so many new faces there was so much happening all the time and i was always a step behind the people were warm and welcoming , however , and their home became my home within the month , the lease was up , and the community disbanded due to a difference in vision between the two cofounders the members were variously scattered across the city and the east bay i joined a wave of 38 people who were moving into a 10 bedroom , four story victorian mansion around the block the founders called it chateau ubuntu , for the bantu word that roughly translates to i am human because you are human on july 1 , i found myself sleeping in a bunk bed in a large third floor master bedroom with five other people , four chandeliers and a fireplace topped by a marble relief of three nude nymphs i lived in that room for nine months a gestation and my experience became a fascinating journey through the building blocks of humanity i discovered that community is a synecdoche for society , and that any human system is just a web of agreements i learned what it takes to keep a co living unit afloat amid the various logistical necessities of city living the rent , the utilities , the food , the facilities and how to facilitate the needs and wants of 38 unique individuals i radically challenged my preconceptions about sharing space , time and resources i fell deeply in love , and i found confidence in my art each day , i awoke with a visceral sense of belonging to the uninitiated , a 38 person community living so densely in a single home often comes across as mad in the act , however , it felt as though nothing could be more natural there were deep and frustrating downsides , of course high membership turnover , too little privacy and some unresolved interpersonal tensions we were rarely able to wrangle a meaningful consensus , with so many people constantly in and out yet the physical closeness , coupled with a culture of radical acceptance , fostered perhaps the most warm and loving community of humans that i have ever experienced for every serious meeting or disagreement , there was a cuddle puddle , a gratitude circle , an impromptu jam session or a big shared meal eventually , i burned out on the sheer density of chateau ubuntu i needed a smaller and less socially absorptive environment in which to create more intention around my work , my art , my life and my love i needed space to think along with a few friends , my partner and i left chateau ubuntu to cofound a new , smaller community our current home , chaortica we remain connected to a colorful coalition of other communities in the greater haight ashbury area and beyond , including ubuntu and the flagship house of the embassy network we ve tapped into the fellowship for intentional community , a global directory of shared living communities that includes communes , eco villages , co ops and collectives of all stripes we don t have it all figured out , but we are working together and collaborating on our dreams indeed , we cannot ever expect this to be perfect as with any team , relationship or government , an intentional community is a constant practice , not a steady state certainly , some of the communities that take root in san francisco are more ephemeral than others there are ventures that fold within a year , and there are cooperatives that raise children in their midst i ve not encountered a house here that did not experience at least some small occasional turnover , but this does not mean that we are building sand castles there is such a vast , wild richness to the spectrum of human experience , and each person whom i ve met has taught me something about myself when we come together across disparate backgrounds , we inform and expand each other s humanity i posit that community living can be just as empowering as living alone but that it is always an exercise in adaptation it works only with empathy , humility and a mutually assured foundation of healthy , open communication one might argue that these practices are essential to the future of our species on a crowding , warming planet of 7 4 billion people cities are denser and pricier than ever , and we must learn to share on a personal and civilizational scale in ways that we have scarcely imagined i do not mean that we all need to live in co ops and communes , but i do contend that it is worthwhile for each of us to reconsider how much we can trust one another i hope that we can all take the principle of collectivism as a nugget in and of itself rather than a subordinate component of gentrification , for collaboration is not a limitation the solution to density is trust , not fear sharing is easier when we parse our wants from our needs life is more meaningful together",1.0

"for instance , the times not only missed the nicaraguan contra cocaine scandal , but actively covered up the reagan administration s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s",1.0
"the times lagged badly , too , on investigating the secret operations that became known as the iran contra affair the times gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the reagan administration for more on this topic , see consortiumnews com s new york times apologist for power",1.0
"in that same era , the washington post performed no better leonard downie , its executive editor at the time of the contra cocaine scandal , has continued to reject the reality of ronald reagan s beloved contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of cia inspector general frederick hitz that , in fact , many contras were neck deep in the cocaine trade and the reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons",1.0
"more recently , during the mad dash to invade iraq in 2002 03 , the post s editorial page editor fred hiatt wrote repeatedly as flat fact that iraq was hiding wmd and mocked the few dissenting voices that challenged the group think",1.0
"yet , hiatt suffered no accountability for his falsehoods and is still the post s editorial page editor , still peddling dubious examples of washington s conventional wisdom",1.0
ministry of truth,1.0
"so , who are the responsible journalists who should be anointed to regulate what the world s public gets to see and hear \? for that orwellian task , a kind of ministry of truth has been set up by google , called the first draft coalition , which touts itself as a collection of 30 major news and technology companies , including the times and post , tackling fake news and creating a platform to decide which stories are questionable and which ones aren t correspondent michael usher of australia s 60 minutes claims to have found the billboard visible in a video of a buk missile launcher after the shoot down of malaysia airlines flight 17 on july 17 , 2014 , but the scenes actually don t match up at all \( screen shot from australia s 60 minutes \)",1.0
"formed in june 2015 and funded by google news lab , the first draft coalition s founding members included bellingcat , an online citizen journalism site that has gotten many of its highest profile stories wrong and is now associated with nato s favorite think tank , the atlantic council",1.0
"despite bellingcat s checkered record and its conflicts of interest through the atlantic council , major western news outlets , including the times and post , have embraced bellingcat , apparently because its articles always seem to mesh neatly with u s and european propaganda on syria and ukraine",1.0
"two of bellingcat s \( or its founder eliot higgins s \) biggest errors were misplacing the firing location of the suspected syrian rocket carrying sarin gas on aug 21 , 2013 , and directing an australian news crew to the wrong site for the so called getaway buk video after the july 17 , 2014 shoot down of malaysia airlines flight 17 a screen shot of the roadway where the suspected buk missile battery supposedly passed after the shoot down of malaysia airlines flight 17 on july 17 , 2014 \( image from australian 60 minutes program \)",1.0
"but like many news outlets that support establishment group thinks , bellingcat wins widespread praise and official endorsements , such as from the international mh 17 investigation that was largely controlled by ukraine s unsavory intelligence agency , the sbu and that accepted bellingcat s dubious mh 17 evidence blaming the russians",1.0
"if such a ministry of truth had existed in the mid 1980s , it might well have denounced the investigative reporting on the contra cocaine scandal since that was initially deemed untrue and if minitrue were around in 2002 03 , it almost surely would have decried the handful of people who were warning against the group think on iraq s wmd",1.0
power and reality,1.0
"while it s undeniable that some false or dubious stories get pushed during the heat of a political campaign and in wartime and journalists have a role in fact checking as best they can there is potentially a greater danger when media insiders arrogate to themselves the power to dismiss contrary evidence as unacceptable , especially given their own history of publishing stories that turned out to be dubious if not entirely false",1.0
it s even more dangerous when these self appointed arbiters of truth combine forces with powerful internet search engines and social media companies to essentially silence dissenting opinions and contrary facts by making them very difficult for the public to locate,1.0
arguably even worse is when politicians whether president elect donald trump or turkish president recep tayyip erdogan or president obama get into the business of judging what is true and what is false,1.0
"on thursday , an impassioned president obama voiced his annoyance with fake news twice in his joint news conference in berlin with german chancellor angela merkel because in an age where there s so much active misinformation and it s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made , then we won t know what to protect",1.0
"let that phrase sink in for a moment we won t know what to protect \? is president obama suggesting that it is the u s government s role to protect certain information and , by implication , leave contrary information unprotected , i e open to censorship \?",1.0

"on wednesday , there was the unseemly scene of state department spokesman john kirby refusing to answer reasonable questions from a russian journalist affiliated with rt",1.0
the rt journalist asked kirby to identify the hospitals and clinics in syria that he was claiming had been hit by russian and syrian airstrikes you might assume that a truth teller would have welcomed the opportunity to provide more details that could then be checked and verified,1.0

"kirby then insisted that since rt was a state owned outlet that its journalists should not be put on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets \( but the reality is that voice of america , bbc and many other western outlets are financed by governments or have ideological benefactors \)",1.0

"for instance , during the early phase of the ukraine crisis in 2014 , secretary of state john kerry called rt a propaganda bullhorn and richard stengel , undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , issued a dipnote saying rt should be ostracized as a source of disinformation",1.0
but stengel s complaint revealed a stunning ignorance about the circumstances surrounding the february 2014 putsch that overthrew ukraine s elected president viktor yanukovych,1.0
"for instance , stengel cited rt s ludicrous assertion about the u s investing 5 billion to promote regime change in ukraine stengel apparently wasn t aware that assistant secretary of state for european affairs victoria nuland had cited the 5 billion figure in support of ukraine s european aspirations during a public speech to u s and ukrainian business leaders on dec 13 , 2013",1.0
"at the time , nuland was a leading proponent of regime change in ukraine , personally cheering on the maidan demonstrators and even passing out cookies in an intercepted , obscenity laced phone call with u s ambassador to ukraine geoffrey pyatt , nuland said her choice to lead ukraine was arseniy yats is the guy yatsenyuk , who ended up as prime minister after the coup",1.0
"so , was stengel a purveyor of fake news when he was accusing rt of disseminating fake news or was he just assembling some propaganda points for his underlings to repeat to a gullible western news media or was he just ill informed \?",1.0

"title because of hillary clinton , emergency contraception is banned in honduras author eric zuesse text because of hillary clinton , emergency contraception is banned in honduras because of hillary clinton , emergency contraception is banned in honduras by eric zuesse of course , one of hillary clinton s proudest claims is that as the u s secretary of state she championed reproductive choice throughout the world she championed it in words , but her actions were sometimes in the opposite direction , and there is perhaps no nation where her actions as the u s secretary of state had a bigger impact than honduras , which case will therefore be examined , and her impact on this documented , here the reason that the morning after pill , which enables raped women to avoid becoming pregnant from a rape , was made illegal by the government that now exists in honduras , is that secretary of state hillary clinton persuaded president barack obama not to terminate u s financial aid to the coup regime that came into power there on 28 june 2009 without that aid , the democratically elected president would quickly have been restored though the u s ambassador in honduras told secretary of state clinton that there was no way in which that coup was legal and that consequently it undoubtedly was a coup and that existing u s law therefore required u s funding of the honduran government to cease immediately , she ignored the law , and she ignored everything except her friend lanny davis the lobbyist whom the coup plotters had hired to represent them to democrats \( a different lobbyist was hired to represent them to the congressional republicans \) president obama took his secretary of state s advice and refused to enforce the law , and hillary clinton publicly praised what the regime was doing the regime was condemned throughout latin america , because the coup , which consisted of the local aristocracy or oligarchs , overthrew the democratically elected president of honduras , who had wanted a land reform law to be introduced immediately after the coup that overthrew him , the newly installed regime allowed the aristocrats paid thugs to murder anyone who tried to lead the opposition and therefore the regime that had been imposed by honduras s aristocracy and kept in power by america s aristocracy , has remained stable since however , after the coup , honduras has had the world s highest murder rate thus , it s a stable but now extraordinarily violent country \( detailed documentation of every allegation in this paragraph can be found in the honduras section of this article i earlier wrote about hillary clinton s six foreign policy catastrophes and that section on honduras , in turn , links to 68 sources , which provide the sometimes gruesome details regarding hillary clinton s impact upon the lives of the honduran people since the coup however , that article didn t mention this matter concerning contraception , rape , and abortion and , so , the present article will be an extension from that earlier one , dealing specifically with hillary clinton s impact upon family planning and reproductive choice in honduras \) one feature of the new , u s backed , regime , was the imposition of draconian fundamentalist laws against contraception and intensifying the abortion ban on 13 february 2012 , the center for reproductive rights headlined honduras supreme court upholds absolute ban on emergency contraception , opens door to criminalize women and medical professionals and reported the honduras supreme court has upheld the country s absolute ban on emergency contraception , which would criminalize the sale , distribution , and use of the morning after pill imposing punishment for offenders equal to that of obtaining or performing an abortion , which in honduras is completely restricted by banning and criminalizing emergency contraception , honduras is telling the world it would rather imprison the women of its country than provide them with safe and effective birth control , said luisa cabal , director of international legal programs at the center for reproductive rights today s decision from the honduras supreme court blatantly disregards women s fundamental reproductive rights and completely ignores the respected medical opinion of experts around the globe it will cause significant harm in the lives countless women and doctors across the country consequently , the hell in honduras has been accentuated by punishment of women who have been raped , and punishment of doctors and pharmacists who try to help them the president whom hillary clinton , barack obama , and the ten main aristocratic families of honduras , overthrew and prohibited from running for president ever again , manuel zelaya , had , in april 2009 , vetoed a law that the honduran legislature \( controlled by those ten families plus another 15 or so \) had just passed to ban the morning after pill so , that law didn t enter into force until the u s imposed regime restored it however , the restoration of the ban wasn t final until this decision was handed down by the honduran supreme court as amnesty international said at that time on 1 february , the supreme court in honduras upheld a decree imposing an absolute ban on emergency contraception this decree was vetoed in may 2009 by the former president on grounds that it conflicted with the constitution the supreme court has now concluded that the decree is constitutional and that congress can begin to develop laws enforcing a ban of the emergency contraceptive pill on the basis of its alleged abortive nature the world health organization , pan american health organization , and several other expert bodies have clearly stated that the emergency contraceptive pill is not abortive it is a form of contraception that works by ensuring the egg is inaccessible and impeding fertilization the criminalization of the emergency contraceptive pill will have appalling consequences for example , rape victims will be unable to prevent pregnancy and so it has been in honduras during the period since the 28 june 2009 honduran u s backed coup , the hell in honduras has been so bad that honduras has become one of the top sources of illegal immigration into the united states the world record high murder rates and crushing poverty , with no opportunity for the public to move up in the world other than through becoming one of the paid enforcers for the aristocrats , which often also entails leading the now booming drug gangs there , has essentially forced out of honduras millions of residents , and many of them have escaped through mexico into the united states , in order to be able to have a decent life , rather than murder and be murdered hillary clinton s opponent in the u s presidential campaign , donald trump , never talks about the hell that clinton and obama have been imposing around the world \( except regarding non christian majority countries such as libya \) , and he seems to view illegal immigrants as if u s foreign policies have nothing to do with creating the problems that those people are facing , but there is no indication that he would continue those policies , which have been causing them to be illegal immigrants here to the contrary , his anti interventionist foreign policy proposals would be inconsistent with coups and invasions regarding any foreign country whose government is not posing an imminent threat to u s national security trump s foreign policy proposals are not in any way favorable toward those of hillary clinton \( who is simply an extreme version of obama s worst policy orientations \) \( and america s own federation of american scientists has stated that obama is lying in order to justify his policy now to ignore existing in force nuclear treaties with russia as being supposedly not violations of them so , though he may not be as much of a neoconservative as she is , he basically is one , too his aggression against russia is subtle , but forceful \) consequently , at least regarding foreign policy , a president trump would be authentic change , irrespective of whether a particular voter would approve of that change as opposed to continuing america s existing foreign policy but in a more extreme way among other things , a vote for hillary clinton is a vote to retain the status quo in honduras and around the world , but to go much farther in the same direction a vote for donald trump is a vote to change that status quo to change \( and in some important respects reverse \) that direction the biggest impact of this election will be on foreign \( including both economic and military \) policy even domestically within the united states , the difference between the two candidates on foreign policies will have a much bigger impact , including possibly even nuclear war , than will the other policy areas , which the general public erroneously think will have a bigger impact upon their lives and their future than will foreign policies \( and here are quoted recent reports in the washington post , spiegel , huffington post , and other serious media , discussing her preparing her coming administration s plans and personnel for a war with russia and obama is right now setting everything up for her to be able to start the war as soon as possible \) regardless of whether the american public know it , the main impact of this presidential election will be on foreign policy , including on the immense impacts that foreign policy will have domestically so this is not the time when the u s will be progressing but instead regressing , and intelligent voters will be aiming to minimize the harms , rather than to achieve progress progress , at this stage so late in the game , is still being hoped for only by some fools who happen to be also progressives any intelligent progressive , at this late stage , is focused entirely upon minimizing the harm and the maximum harm could happen with surprising rapidity \( back in 1961 , the estimation of experts was that as one of the few who spoke publicly stated a nuclear war between the united states and russia would be all over in 24 or 48 hours because both sides would let go with their full atomic arsenals the estimates today are far more precise but unpublished , and they re all well under an hour some as low as 20 minutes \) there wouldn t be any surrender , nor any armistice there would only be the end of civilization , and unspeakable misery \( including details that are ignored by the major media , such as this \) until practically everyone is dead \( from starvation if nothing else \) those are the stakes in this election even to be debating domestic issues at a time like this , simply doesn t make any sense but the situation in honduras points up the ridiculousness , in a fundamentally different context , which is why i am writing about it now",1.0

"referring to the western elites downplaying the growing gap between rich and poor , putin said",1.0
"it seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class , while at the same time , they implant ideological ideas that , in my opinion , are destructive to cultural and national identity and in certain cases , in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favor of the suzerain",1.0
"putin reminded everyone that current situation of instability in the world is a direct result of the choice made by the united states after the end of the cold war to take the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests by taking this course , the u s missed a chance to make globalization more harmonious and sustainable in nature",1.0
"in their euphoria of winning the cold war , the united states essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life , chose not to improve or create universal institutions , and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations , norms and rules they chose the road of globalization and security for their own beloved selves , for the select few , and not for all but far from everyone was ready to agree with this",1.0
"this victorious attitude led to the system of international relations where rules and principles , in the economy and in politics , are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely",1.0
"on the western hypocrisy and double talk , putin said",1.0
"if the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage , they force everyone else to comply but if tomorrow these same standards get in their way , they are swift to throw them in the bin , declare them obsolete , and set or try to set new rules",1.0
"russian president reminded about the u s led decision to launch airstrikes in the center of europe , against belgrade , and then came iraq , and then libya , and turning the un into a tool of u s foreign policy",1.0
"the operations in afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the united nations security council in their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favor these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defense systems they created and armed terrorist groups , whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight , made millions of displaced persons and immigrants , and plunged entire regions into chaos",1.0
"in the global economy , multilateral institutions also became a tool to promote the interests of few",1.0
"we see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure , bypass the world trade organization and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers , in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations and we know this is happening they see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the wto framework and so think , why not throw the rules and the organization itself aside and build a new one instead",1.0
"always referring to the u s as some of our partners , putin stressed that they demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today instead of making osce , a crucial mechanism for ensuring common european and also trans atlantic security , it was shaped into an instrument in the service of someone s foreign policy interests",1.0
"about constant vilification of russia and trumpeting of russian aggression , putin said they continue to churn out threats , imaginary and mythical threats such as the russian military threat this is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets at home , get allies to bend to a single superpower s interests , expand nato and bring its infrastructure , military units and arms closer to our borders",1.0
"of course , it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilization against the new barbarians the only thing is that russia has no intention of attacking anyone this is all quite absurd",1.0
"it is unthinkable , foolish and completely unrealistic it is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts and yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims",1.0
"the question is , if things continue in this vein , what awaits the world \? what kind of world will we have tomorrow \? do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability , security and sustainable economic growth \? do we know how we will make a more prosperous world \?",1.0

title georgia abandons ukraine 's anti russian obsession archil sikharulidze author nan text your daily reality snack georgia abandons ukraine 's anti russian obsession,1.0
"after a brief period in which both ukraine and georgia appeared to be united against russia , it now appears that the two nations are moving along very different paths originally appeared at russia direct",1.0
"in october , georgia didn t support any of ukraine s resolutions denouncing the kremlin s foreign policy within the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe \( pace \) that is surprising , given how many analysts had by now assumed that georgia and ukraine were on the same page when it came to russia",1.0
"the two resolutions deal with the political implications of russia s aggression in ukraine and human rights abuses on the occupied ukrainian territories by supporting them , pace recognized the military conflict in ukraine as russian aggression for the first time and called on the kremlin to withdraw its forces from the eastern part of ukraine moreover , it denounced the parliamentary elections , recently conducted by russia in crimea",1.0
"when the georgian delegation in pace didn t support these resolutions , the nation s pro western parties reacted strongly for example , the united national movement lambasted the georgian government and accused the country s former prime minister , bidzina ivanishvili , of supporting russia moreover , mikheil saakashvili , the former georgian president and now the governor of the odessa region in ukraine , described such a stance as a disgraceful move",1.0
"however , an immediate response came from one of the members of the georgian delegation in pace , eka beselia she retorted that tbilisi needed to defend its own national interests even though this statement seems to have alleviated the increasing conflict , the video of russian ukrainian journalist matwey ganapolsky , who accuses georgia of betraying ukraine in favor of russia , fuelled the tensions in contrast , russian pundits see the unwillingness of georgia to vote for the pace resolution as a sign of improvement in tbilisi moscow relations",1.0
"in reality , the reluctance of the georgian dream , the ruling party in georgia , to approve these resolutions is just the logical conclusion of complicated relations with kiev since the start of the color revolutions in the post soviet space , georgia and ukraine were largely in the same boat",1.0
"after the success of the rose revolution in tbilisi and the orange revolution in kiev , the newly elected governments were closely connected with each other and teamed up against russia this resulted from friendly relations between ukraine s former prime minister yulia timoshenko and former president viktor yushchenko on the one hand , and georgia s saakashvili on the other hand",1.0
"however , their relationship was rather pragmatic in its nature , although officially tbilisi recognized ukraine as one of its closest allies since 2007 the democratic processes in the two countries have started moving in a reverse direction saakashvili s penchant for conducting an aggressive policy as well as his authoritarian inclinations was increasing , while ukraine faced the corruption and the political rivalry between timoshenko and yushchenko",1.0
"the more impact this had on the countries stability and development , the more obvious became the fact that the ruling elites from both sides did not support democratic reforms , but only the regimes that were friendly to them thus , georgian ukrainian relations could be seen as a form of cooperation between governments , not between the people",1.0
"and this trend became relevant until the 2010 presidential elections , when georgia s civil society and population called on the government to support democratic processes and regime change in its brother country from then on , georgia has been shying away from supporting the political regime in ukraine and focusing more on the support of the country s own population",1.0
"however , ukraine refused to consider such tactics , with its official representatives criticizing the georgian dream coalition for supporting russia during the 2012 parliamentary elections moreover , kiev cooperated with georgia s united national movement , which was openly accused of building an authoritarian regime and egregious human rights abuses",1.0
"logically , the new georgian government under ivanishvili cannot help paying attention to this fact but it was relatively reticent and didn t respond , even when georgian volunteers came to fight in eastern ukraine to support kiev and accused tbilisi of supporting russia that had some implications for the georgian dream it was seen as a political force that is capable of defending the country s national interests",1.0
"moreover , georgian voters also saw the fact that saakashvili was appointed as the governor of the odessa region as an unfriendly move from ukraine , as a slap in the face , because the former georgian president was legally prosecuted in his home country , which meant that ivanishvili couldn t fulfill his pledges and restore justice during the election campaign he promised to put saakashvili in jail for corruption and the abuse of power editor s note the problem was exacerbated when kiev granted saakashvili ukrainian citizenship , which made it impossible to imprison the former georgian president",1.0
"saakashvili crossed the red line during the latest parliamentary elections in georgia during the campaign first , his colleagues from the united national movement visited ukraine second , he openly called for a coup d tat against the georgian government , which he sees as pro russian in fact , he threatened to conduct a new revolution in georgia this was the last straw for the georgian dream",1.0
it is safe to say that the current georgian political elites started seeing ukraine as a real headache and the shelter for dubious and controversial georgian politicians from the united national movement accused of different wrongdoings and legal violations,1.0
"however , with the victory of the georgian dream in the 2016 parliamentary elections , a lot has changed moreover , the odds of the party of winning the constitutional majority are really high it means that the influence of the party is growing in the georgian parliament and even more could change",1.0
"as a result , the government won t necessarily have to take into account the views of other political forces to take decisions it can be pretty outspoken now that it won t put up with anti government moves and initiatives like the ones promoted by saakashvili moreover , the georgian voters , who are seeking to have those involved in the violations during saakashvili s tenure prosecuted so , in this regard , the electorate supports the georgian dream",1.0
"thus , all this indicates that georgian ukrainian relations have always been more complex and nuanced than they seemed to be at first glance during saakashvili s tenure , there was cooperation between his government and the ones of timoshenko and yushchenko however , eventually , tbilisi shifted its priority from supporting top political officials to supporting society and people",1.0
"ukrainian politicians should keep in mind that the russian factor is not the only one that determines the ukrainian georgian agenda providing shelter to saakashvili also does matter so , to improve the relations with tbilisi , kiev should take into account its national interest and support the georgian people instead of the country s politicians",1.0

"we do it indirectly because it s unlawful to do it directly , he said , adding that the us keeps extremely violent organizations off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to isil and al qaeda",1.0

"and now you see this emerging threat against western europe by turkey , he noted , further adding that erdogan has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the ottoman empire",1.0

"we don t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they re our good allies , he said , concluding that washington is on a suicidal course of action",1.0

"title bulgaria moldova switch from hillary 's euro atlantic column author mark almond text written by mark almond november 13th was as unlucky for stalwart backers of the foreign policy line embodied by hillary clinton just as 8th november was for her domestic supporters in both bulgaria and moldova , the voters rejected candidates for president who had been openly endorsed by washington and brussels having witnessed how small states with tiny electorates but vital electoral college votes dealt body blows to hillary clinton 's hopes of winning the us presidency , it would be short sighted and arrogant as the euro atlantic establishment has so often been to dismiss voters in small east european states as irrelevant having presumed that bulgaria was irretrievably anchored in the euro atlantic power structure by its accession to both nato and the eu , the choice of an openly pro russian candidate for president of the country is a wake up call to brussels and washington similarly , the moldovan elite had seemed locked into an irreversible course as its premier put it to integration better said subordination to the euro atlantic model in both cases , the majority of citizens thought different until the implosion of the neo con regime change foreign policy embodied by hillary clinton and her attack dog for eastern europe , victoria neuland , we could have been confident that the heavy hands of washington and brussels would have pressured both bulgaria and moldova to reverse such results yet even cash inducements like the imf 's sudden dole of us 36 million to the moldovan regime just six days before the poll could not buy enough support even more striking was the bulgarian public 's rejection of the pro eu candidate who had boasted about how much eu aid to the poverty stricken balkan eu member was at stake what ordinary bulgarians and moldovans know , and what the euro atlantic elites and media never admit , is that eu funds have been a motor of the corruption suffocating their economies precisely because of the easy pickings eu and imf cash provides to the ruling elites , they have no incentive to act in the majority 's interests real reforms are tough to enact and make the people richer not the insiders in the political class until trump 's election , the usa and eu deployed their massive power and influence to making any vote against their policy options seem futile despite popular recognition of how they had gutted the productive aspects of both the bulgarian and the moldovan economies sunday 's elections in both countries may be straws in the wind they are victories for the genuine people power of the ballot box , not the street based populism of crowds favoured by washington and brussels to impose people power on the people it is striking that the bulgarian premier , borisov , who is often criticised as authoritarian by state media in the eu like deutsche welle and the bbc as well as by euronews , immediately resigned he drew the democratic consequence of his own candidate 's defeat but the premier of moldova , filip , who has been boosted by euronews etc as a model european , immediately said the popular vote would have no effect on his policies ! even so , the election of advocates of better ties to russia is a small geo political earthquake in states nato and the eu saw as securely controlled bases for launching anti putin policies no one has died in these tremors in bulgaria and moldova but the fact that the upheaval has been peaceful through the ballot box leaves only violence as a viable way of reversing the will of the people both bulgaria in 1997 and moldova in 2009 saw violent putsches from the street enthusiastically endorsed in brussels and washington as people power if the kind of soros sponsored protests americans themselves are now witnessing at home against trump are switched on in the east european dissident states the counter explosion could destabilise the whole eu nato project in the vast post communist region which had seemed willing to lick the west 's hand no matter how often the west had imposed destructive poverty promoting policies but now it would be unwise to think that the east european dogs can be kicked with impunity they could turn vicious as the french say and bite back a change of course in washington could re earn the pro american consensus squandered over the last twenty five years by the cynical euro atlantic consensus but can western elites swallow their pride and learn the lesson of popular alienation or will they sink into denial and double down on the policies which have rendered them despised by ordinary folk who see through phony rhetoric about swallowing touch economic medicine for their own good east europeans know that playing the reform politician not the entrepreneur is the way to get rich in their societies sadly , a lot of people in the west are coming to a similar conclusion so the trump effect has emboldened the ordinary voters of eastern europe to demand that their elite put the people first maybe the donald did n't mean that to be the outflow of his victory in the usa , but that 's how people there see it if the rigid and impoverishing policies promoted by the us eu consensus cannot be revised , then more results like those in bulgaria and moldova can be expected what should worry the us eu establishment is that elections are coming in countries which wo n't be so easy to ignore as small east european states next spring , the dutch and the french vote the anti establishment tide in those two important eu and nato states is running strongly years of rhetoric about reform and anti corruption strategies across the new europe of the old soviet bloc coincided with rampant influence peddling and bribe taking drain the swamp ! was one of trump 's most effective slogans across europe , it echoes powerfully precisely because of the hypocrisy and cynicism of domestic and brussels based elites who talked so loudly about their commitment to the right kind of anti corruption strategies but , as east europeans say , have their left hand cupped behind their backs related",1.0
title will michelle obama be the replacement nominee if the fbi email investigation ends hillary clinton s campaign \? author michael snyder text posted by michael snyder,1.0
"i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre , but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650 , 000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails , it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november 8th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action , it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day , and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate",1.0
"in fact , there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example , the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled democrats should ask clinton to step aside",1.0
so what should the democrats do now \?,1.0
"if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern , they would follow a simple process",1.0
"they would demand that mrs clinton step down , immediately , and let her vice presidential nominee , sen tim kaine of virginia , stand in her place",1.0
"democrats should say , honestly , that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home brew email server from the time she was secretary of state , having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea",1.0
"but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article , i included a quote from a u s news world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november 8th",1.0
"if clinton were to fall off the ticket , democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this year s primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat rocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont",1.0
"dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members a number that changes over time and is guided by the group s bylaws , which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states , along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill",1.0
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed,1.0
"so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute , a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee",1.0
who would they choose \?,1.0
let s take a look at the top five options,1.0
1 tim kaine,1.0
"he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clinton s running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition , and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him",1.0
"and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact , attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens",1.0
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee,1.0
2 joe biden,1.0
"vice president joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does , and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run",1.0
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it,1.0
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was re opening their criminal probe into clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second guess his decision last year not to run,1.0
"but according to the vice president , the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running , biden said , was the recent death of his son , beau",1.0
"unfortunately for biden , he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does",1.0
"biden is boring , he is not very good on the campaign trail , and he doesn t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers",1.0
"biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats , but he might not be a winning choice",1.0
3 bernie sanders,1.0
"bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner up to hillary clinton , but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders",1.0
"first of all , he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent , and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over",1.0
"secondly , the democratic establishment very much dislikes him , and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this",1.0
"thirdly , democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election",1.0
"so even though he is very popular with the radical left , it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list",1.0
4 elizabeth warren,1.0
"elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party , and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman",1.0
so she is definitely a possibility,1.0
"but she does lack name recognition , and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies",1.0
5 michelle obama,1.0
one recent survey found that 67 percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton,1.0
and these days barack obama s approval rating is running anywhere from 9 to 11,1.0
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as far fetched as you might think,1.0
"michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list , and she is generally very well liked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance , her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign in a recent msn article entitled in this campaign , michelle obama became more than just another political voice",1.0
"the speech , amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response , cemented obama s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump , but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house , she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title",1.0
"when you rise to a level like that , you see how much weight your words carry , said anita mcbride , former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didn t like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used , and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her",1.0
"if i were the democrats , michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed , because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump",1.0
"of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren , but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point",1.0
"and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside , because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her",1.0
"in the final analysis , none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day , but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen",1.0
"and if it does happen , it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down",1.0

title dilbert creator explains how do i know the emails are that bad \? author zero hedge text,1.0
"if you re following the news , you know fbi director james comey announced that the fbi found a bunch of emails on anthony weiner s laptop",1.0
"as dilbert creator scott adams notes , there appears to be two main observations",1.0
1 comey seemed pro clinton when he dropped the initial email case,1.0
2 comey seems anti clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election,1.0
"so , how can both behaviors be explained \?",1.0
first some background from adams on the persuasion filter,1.0
"as my regular readers know , the persuasion filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality in order for us to be here today , our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate they had no need to understand reality at any basic level and we have no such need either that s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and i might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival i like to describe reality as each person living their own movie , which works well unless our script s conflict when that happens , one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent",1.0
that s how i see the world,1.0
last year in this blog i suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what i call the persuasion filter that s what i have been using to make spooky good predictions about the election so far and that s what i ll use today to give you an alternate movie about james comey compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future,1.0
"the base assumption of the persuasion filter is that people are irrational 90 of the time and only rarely when no emotions are involved truly rational this is the reverse of the common filter for reality , in which people are assumed to be rational 90 of the time and a bit crazy 10 of the time that s some background for context",1.0

"so , back to comey , adams asks which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future \?",1.0
some say comey is a political pawn in a rigged system by that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case but we can t explain why he s acting against clinton s interests now what changed \?,1.0
"well , some say comey had to reopen the case against clinton after discovering the weiner laptop emails if he failed to act , there might be a revolt at the fbi and maybe a whistleblower would come forward but that leaves unexplained why comey detailed to congress how clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the fbi was dropping the case if comey had been protecting clinton on the first round , he would have softened his description of her misdeeds , wouldn t he \? but he didn t seem to hold back anything",1.0
"and none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know comey have high regard for his integrity comey also has the security of a 10 year appointment as director , so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced that s exactly why the job has a 10 year term given what we know of comey before any of the clinton emails , any movie that casts comey as an ass covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake",1.0
so allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass covering weasel compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting,1.0
"my movie says comey had good evidence against clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the american public for reasons of conscience , and acting as a patriot , comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the fbi found against clinton the evidence looked damning because it was under this interpretation , comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the republic he didn t want the fbi to steal this important decision away from the people , but at the same time he couldn t let the people decide blind so he divulged the evidence and stepped away , like the action hero who doesn t look back at the explosion",1.0
"in the second act of this movie , comey learns that the weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag and a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence that would violate clinton s rights",1.0
but comey couldn t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against fbi policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day so comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting,1.0
"in this movie , comey did the hero thing he alerted the public to the fact that the fbi found disqualifying information on the weiner laptop and he took a second bullet to his reputation",1.0
how do i know the new emails are that bad \?,1.0
i start by assuming comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions and even comey s critics concede he s smart,1.0
so,1.0
"the way you know the new emails are disqualifying for clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections comey is smart enough to know his options and unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age , he s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the republic",1.0
"according to this movie , no matter who gets elected , we ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the weiner emails",1.0
and we can t say we weren t warned comey took two bullets to do it,1.0
"so compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts and when we find out what is in the weiner laptop emails , compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifying",1.0
"the persuasion filter says there is no preferred reality we all see our own movies in my movie , comey s has a consistent personality from start to finish he starts out his career as a smart , competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the republic if your movie script has comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season , don t expect an oscar",1.0

"title n f l wins appeal , and tom brady has little recourse the new york times author ken belson text roger goodell , the most powerful man in professional football , prevailed again monday in his battle with tom brady , one of the game s most celebrated quarterbacks and this time , brady has virtually no chance of escaping a suspension goodell s victory came in a ruling by a panel of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit that overturned a decision and affirmed that goodell , the n f l commissioner , had broad discretion to suspend players according to the collective bargaining agreement with the players union the panel s decision can be appealed to the full second circuit , or even the supreme court , but the chance of a victory for brady is close to nil , said michael leroy , who teaches labor law at the university of illinois at assuming nothing changes , brady could return to regular play as soon as oct 9 the n f l s decision in the deflategate case suspending one of its most popular players for being generally aware of a plot to deflate footballs in the 2015 a f c championship game captivated the nation like few football stories over the years , sports leagues have fought with some of their best players , including cases in which major league baseball butted heads with barry bonds and alex rodriguez but never has a showdown between a league and a player centered on whether the player wanted to manipulate the air pressure in a ball the case drew expert analysis from physicists and excoriation from fans many in new england who believed that the commissioner s ruling was based on inadequate evidence the saga raised fundamental questions about fairness on the field how teams look for an edge and whether the commissioner , who views himself as a stern taskmaster , had overstepped his bounds the league s decision to go after brady also pitted the commissioner against robert k kraft , the owner of the patriots and long one of goodell s staunchest allies at the super bowl in arizona shortly after the scandal broke , kraft , in a highly unusual move for an owner , lambasted the league for its handling of the case during an impromptu news conference he also objected to the 1 million fine and loss of draft picks imposed on his team , but eventually accepted the penalties brady s lawyers had argued that he was unfairly suspended after he was accused of involvement in a scheme to deflate footballs used in a playoff game , and last summer , a federal district court judge agreed , allowing brady to play the entire 2015 season the n f l appealed that ruling to the second circuit , which heard oral arguments in early march the judges were openly skeptical of many of the arguments made by brady s lawyer , signaling that they sided with the n f l s case that goodell had broad discretion to suspend players in their decision , the judges did not consider the underlying facts of the case , including the science of football deflation , but instead looked solely at whether goodell , as arbitrator , acted in the spirit of the collective bargaining agreement we hold that the commissioner properly exercised this broad discretion under the collective bargaining agreement and that his procedural rulings were properly grounded in that agreement and did not deprive brady of fundamental fairness , judges barrington daniels parker jr and denny chin wrote in their opinion accordingly , we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to confirm the award in a dissent , chief judge robert a katzmann said that goodell had overstepped his role as arbitrator by changing his reason for penalizing brady after he had heard the quarterback s appeal initially , goodell suspended brady for his role in the plot to deflate footballs , then argued that brady had obstructed the league s investigation of the incident by destroying his cellphone , which might have contained messages between brady and members of the patriots staff the second circuit made the right ruling that conforms to a very well established pattern in the labor law , leroy said the judges said that despite the protestations of kraft , brady and the n f l players association , goodell was merely acting on the powers to which the league and union had agreed in their labor deal , the latest of which was signed in 2011 the judges acknowledged that the pact in which the person who penalizes players also listens to appeals of those penalties might be unconventional , but they would not get in the way of a longstanding and transparent contract in their collective bargaining agreement , the players and the league mutually decided many years ago that the commissioner should investigate possible rule violations , should impose appropriate sanctions , and may preside at arbitrations challenging his discipline , the judges wrote the n f l hailed the decision we are pleased the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled today that the commissioner properly exercised his authority under the collective bargaining agreement to act in cases involving the integrity of the game , it said in a statement that authority has been recognized by many courts and has been expressly incorporated into every collective bargaining agreement between the n f l and n f l p a for the past 40 years the players association said it was disappointed we fought roger goodell s suspension of tom brady because we know he did not serve as a fair arbitrator and that players rights were violated under our collective bargaining agreement , it said in a statement if brady s suspension is not overturned by a higher court , he will presumably sit out the first four games of the season \( he is allowed to play and practice with the team in the preseason \) the patriots play their opening game in glendale , ariz against the cardinals , and their next three games at home , in foxborough , mass against the miami dolphins , the houston texans and the buffalo bills brady would then be eligible to return in week 5 , when the patriots travel to cleveland to play the browns the drama began on jan 18 , 2015 , when the new england patriots hammered the indianapolis colts , to advance to the super bowl shortly after the game , the n f l began investigating whether the patriots had used deflated footballs to gain an unfair advantage it s ridiculous , brady said at the time , adding , that s the last of my worries the n f l released the results of its investigation last may , which stated that two patriots employees had knowingly deflated balls below the legal limit and that it was more probable than not that brady was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities a few days after the release of the report , the n f l suspended brady for four games without pay by some measures , the case has done nothing to dent brady s popularity , or the country s fascination with one of the sport s biggest stars on monday , the players association said that licensed merchandise with brady s name on it was the among all players last season , topping peyton manning , russell wilson and other popular players given the patriots success the past 15 years , some fans are scrambling to adjust to the possibility that brady will sit out the first four weeks of the season bookmaker sportsbook is reassessing its predictions for the patriots season opener against the cardinals jimmy garoppolo is certainly serviceable , but he s not tom brady , the company wrote about brady s backup and putting him under center on sunday night football in week 1 for his first career n f l start is asking quite a bit , especially against an elite arizona secondary",1.0

"title men , is exercise putting a damper on your sex life \? the new york times author gretchen reynolds text men who exercise strenuously may have a lower libido than those whose workouts are lighter , according to one of the first studies to scientifically delve into the relationship between men s workouts and their sex lives for years , scientists and active people have debated whether and how exercise affects sexual desire and human reproduction but most past studies have centered on women typically , this research has found that when some female athletes , such as marathon runners , train intensely for many hours a week , they can develop menstrual dysfunctions these problems seem caused by hormonal imbalances related to physical stress and frequently affect a woman s interest in sex and her ability to conceive but such dysfunctions are rare and usually resolve after the athlete lightens her training load less is known about the effects of exercise , especially heavy exercise , on men s libidos and fertility there have been hints that , in moderate amounts , physical activity increases the male body s production of the hormone testosterone , which theoretically should ramp up sex drive other small studies , on the other hand , have suggested that lengthy and grueling training may blunt the levels of testosterone in a man s bloodstream both immediately and over the long term but those studies examined only hormone changes related to exercise , which can be measured easily , and not differences in sexual emotions and behavior , which are tougher to quantify so for the new study , which was published this month in medicine science in sports exercise , researchers at the university of north carolina in chapel hill decided to ask active men about their sex lives they began by developing a questionnaire based on earlier psychological research into men s sexual behavior that asked , for instance , how often they thought about and engaged in sex the scientists also created a separate questionnaire with detailed queries about exercise habits , including how often and intensely the men worked out each week a final set of questions asked about general health and medical histories then the researchers contacted running , cycling and triathlon training groups , university athletic departments , and publications targeted at endurance athletes and asked them to alert members and readers to the questionnaires , which were available online almost 1 , 100 physically active adult men completed all of the questions most were experienced athletes who had participated for years in training and competitions the scientists used their responses to stratify the men based on both the extent and intensity of their workouts they wound up with groups whose weekly exercise was short , moderately lengthy or quite prolonged , and separately whose weekly exercise was light , moderate or extremely intense it was possible , of course , for someone to be in the top or bottom of both of these categories , meaning that their workouts were both long and intense or light and short but the scientists wanted to examine each of those aspects of a workout separately , so did not track such overlaps they also categorized the men according to their answers about their sex lives , creating groups with relatively high , moderate or low libidos finally , they compared the men s exercise habits to their reported interest and engagement in sex and there were clear patterns the men whose exercise routines were moderate or light in intensity or duration were far more likely to report moderate or high libidos than were the men whose workouts were especially prolonged or intense , even after the researchers controlled for age \( older men tend to report less interest in sex , although not by much \) in effect , strenuous exercise was associated with lower libido , says anthony hackney , a professor of exercise physiology and nutrition at the university of north carolina who led the study of course , this was a small sample of men who voluntarily chose to complete a personally intrusive survey it is impossible to know whether they were truthful or representative of the rest of their gender this type of study also cannot tell us whether too much exercise actually causes low libido , only that the two are linked and it did not examine why strenuous exercise might dampen libidos but dr hackney speculates that both physical fatigue and lower testosterone levels after exhausting exercise likely play a role he and his colleagues hope to soon mount experiments that directly track exercise , hormone levels and libidos to learn more about their interactions they also aim to learn more about whether the intensity of the workouts or duration has the greater impact on male sex drive perhaps most important , he hopes eventually to pin down at what point exercise might start to lower some men s libidos both moderate and light physical activity were associated in this study with relatively high libidos , he points out but there does seem be a potential tipping point , after which more exercise may blunt desire the necessary studies likely will require years and many cooperative men to complete in the meantime , he suggests that if someone is worried about whether his training is affecting his sex life , he might try exercising a little less , to see if his libido changes this advice could be especially important for couples trying to conceive , he says fertility specialists will often ask a woman about whether and how much she exercises , he says based on our data , we think they should also be asking the man",1.0
"title u s drone strike targets taliban leader the new york times author helene cooper text washington an american drone strike targeted the leader of the taliban , mullah akhtar muhammad mansour , in pakistan near the border with afghanistan , united states officials said on saturday , in the most significant american incursion inside pakistan since navy seals killed osama bin laden , the qaeda leader , in 2011 in a statement issued on saturday , peter cook , the pentagon press secretary , said the military was still assessing whether mullah mansour was killed in the strike , which was carried out by an unmanned drone mr cook said mullah mansour was actively involved in planning attacks in kabul and across afghanistan , and had been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of afghanistan and the taliban , prohibiting taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict a united states official , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military operation , said that the strike occurred around 6 a m eastern time on saturday , and that mullah mansour and a second adult male fighter traveling with him in a vehicle were probably killed even so , officials offered caution because early assessments of the deaths of militant and terrorist leaders in american strikes have proved inaccurate in the past the drone strike , authorized by president obama , took place in a remote area of pakistan along the border with afghanistan , southwest of the town of ahmad wal the strike was carried out by several unmanned aircraft operated by united states special operations forces , the official said news of the strike came as gen joseph votel , head of the united states central command , was completing a secret trip to northern syria , where he visited american special operations forces and met with local fighters being trained by the united states in the battle against the islamic state general votel is the american military official to travel to syria during the war but the strike against mullah mansour served as a reminder that even as the obama administration has talked of an end of combat operations in afghanistan and has focused on fighting the islamic state in iraq and syria , the fighting in afghanistan and the risk of rising militancy there has continued since the death of mullah omar and mansour s assumption of leadership , the taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of afghan civilians and afghan security forces as well as numerous u s and coalition personnel , mr cook said in a statement announcing the airstrike mullah mansour had long remained a mystery to american policy makers and the united states military in the 1990s , he was the taliban government s chief of aviation while afghanistan had few planes he also oversaw the tourism department when there were few tourists but in the years after the taliban leadership was driven into exile in pakistan in 2001 , mullah mansour became central to the group s reincarnation as a powerful insurgency after the death of the taliban s founder , mullah muhammad omar , mullah mansour became the group s supreme leader and the architect of the most recent insurgent assault that swept across northern afghanistan yet even as he was acting leader of the taliban , he kept secret the fact that mullah omar had been dead since 2013 and unlike mullah omar , mullah mansour did not live in hiding some of the time he lived in a southern neighborhood of quetta , pakistan , in an enclave where he and other taliban leaders from the same pashtun tribe , the ishaqzai , had built homes and although he is on the united nations list , mullah mansour has repeatedly taken flights in and out of pakistan , afghanistan officials said , to dubai , where he has a house and several investments even as the taliban operating inside afghanistan remains a formidable and violent force , mullah mansour has had difficulties uniting his ranks after months of infighting in april , for example , a taliban spokesman said the new leader had appointed the brother and son of mullah omar , the movement s deceased founder , to senior leadership posts mullah mansour has faced criticism and even rebellion from field commanders who distrusted his ties to pakistan and his handling of the succession he brutally quashed breakaway groups and sought to buy the support of other skeptical commanders , all while maintaining a publicity campaign that has portrayed him atop a united command after his confirmation as the new leader of the insurgency , when large gatherings of taliban were held in quetta , mullah mansour had limited his movements in recent months , afghan officials say while the reason given to his subordinates was security he narrowly missed an attempt on his life , blamed on dissidents within taliban ranks , in december keeping the leader at a distance from the commanders follows a pattern that became routine under mullah omar mullah mansour s deputies , including sirajuddin haqqani , who is largely running battlefield operations , continue to move freely in pakistan",1.0
"title it s probably a bad idea to sell stocks because you fear trump the new york times author neil irwin text so should i cash out of the stock market \? this is the question i ve heard from several friends in the last few months i get a few emails in this vein every time the stock market hits new highs , as it did on friday they are worried that the combination of high share prices and an erratic president mean that the only direction for stocks is down they are considering shifting some of their assets into cash or bonds the short and safe answer to give them is i don t know but there s also a long answer letting one s political opinions shape investing decisions is a good way to lose money whether a given chunk of your savings should be in stocks , bonds or cash depends on your appetite for risk and when you re going to need that money it shouldn t be shaped by whether you love or hate the current occupant of the white house we all have a tendency to fall for motivated reasoning if you think president trump and his policies are bad , there s a natural tendency to think that this will soon be reflected in share prices that could turn out to be true but politics makes us stupid it can cause us to overweight the risks and perils we want to see , and underweight the possibility that , at least in terms of markets , things could go quite well first , much of the movement in stocks has little to do with what the president of the united states does it would be silly to credit bill clinton with the boom that took place during his presidency , or to blame george w bush for the collapse of it but even when the action in washington is driving markets , it is easy to be blinded by your political opinions the response to the financial crisis by the obama administration and the federal reserve in early 2009 succeeded at ending the recession and setting the united states economy on an expansion that continues to this day conservatives tended to malign the stock market rally every step of the way but those who put their money where their mouth was that is , into cash instead of stocks lost out on a 182 percent gain in the standard poor s 500 during the obama presidency liberals are just as susceptible to this motivated reasoning barry ritholtz of ritholtz wealth management recalls hearing friends in the hedge fund industry confidently assert in 2003 that the bush tax cuts would be bad for markets by blowing out the budget deficit and failing to create jobs instead , the stock market rose steadily from that point until late 2007 there s certainly no guarantee that the stock market will continue to rise under the trump administration there are ways that the outlook for investors could get better , and also plenty of ways for them to get worse it s very likely there will be corporate tax cuts and deregulation , both of which benefit companies bottom lines in a pretty direct and measurable way it is optimism about those policy priorities that has driven the market rally since election day throw in some extra government spending on the military and public infrastructure , and you have a recipe for speedier growth maybe the pragmatic , figures in the trump administration will prevail in internal battles , meaning that , whatever you think of the broader policy agenda , there could be boom times for corporate bottom lines there are , of course , darker possibilities president trump could spark a trade war that could turn into a global recession military conflict could break out with a major trading partner like china or could disrupt oil supplies in the middle east and a small crisis could spiral into something bigger because of mr trump s management style whatever probability you assign to positive and negative outcomes , it s hard to dispute that the range of possibilities for what the global economy will look like in four years is uncommonly large all else being equal , more variation in the economic future means that stocks are riskier it s also true that by many measures stock valuations are high investing 100 in the s p 500 buys only about 4 69 in annual earnings , down from 5 06 before the election there is always the possibility of a major correction something that would be true no matter who was in the oval office if that scares you , your money probably shouldn t be in the stock market if you are planning to tap into those investments in the next few years and a 25 percent drop would be devastating , that s all the more reason to limit your exposure to the market stocks tend to offer good returns , but can deliver low or negative returns for many years at a time moving money out of stocks because you need it within the next few years and can t stomach that kind of risk is one thing but making a move just because you lack confidence in president trump could be a case of letting ideology trump investing discipline",1.0

he is not here , but has risen remember how he told you , while he was still in galilee , that the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise and they remembered his words , and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest now it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles , but these words seemed to them an idle tale , and they did not believe them but peter rose and ran to the tomb , stooping and looking in , he saw the linen cloths by themselves and he went home marveling at what had happened that very day two of them were going to a village named emmaus , about seven miles from jerusalem , and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened while they were talking and discussing together , jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were kept from recognizing him and he said to them , what is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk \? and they stood still , looking sad then one of them , named cleopas , answered him , are you the only visitor to jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days \? and he said to them , what things \?

see my hands and my feet , that it is i myself touch me , and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that i have and when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet and while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling , he said to them , have you anything here to eat \?

"title marine le pen denies french guilt for rounding up jews the new york times author adam nossiter text paris a casual remark about france s wartime actions by marine le pen , the leader of the national front , threatened on monday to derail her yearslong effort aimed at her party just as she is emerging as a strong contender in this month s presidential election the remark was made on sunday during an interview in which she referred to the most notorious roundup of jews in france during world war ii , when nearly 13 , 000 were arrested in paris by the french police on july 16 and 17 , 1942 , in what is known as the vel d hiv roundup france wasn t responsible for the vel d hiv , she said if there was responsibility , it is with those who were in power at the time , it is not with france france has been mistreated , in people s minds , for years ms le pen s words created a small eruption in an already heated campaign , drawing strong criticism by politicians right , left and center and by jewish groups , who all saw it as an echo of her party s roots in addition , the remark contradicted over 20 years of state policy , which has been to recognize french responsibility for the roundup , in which thousands of men , women and children were rousted from their homes by french police officers , parked in a stinking overcrowded sports arena in paris the v lodrome d hiver , which has since been destroyed and eventually deported to their deaths in concentration camps ms le pen s words also flew in the face of over four decades of historical research into the eager collaboration of the wartime french government , which had been installed in the spa town of vichy it was the french government s police chief , ren bousquet a favorite of the head of the government at the time who organized the roundup , impressing his german counterparts with his energy vichy did not have a knife to its throat , the historian philippe burrin wrote of the vel d hiv roundup in his landmark book , la france l heure allemande , \( france under the germans \) without the help of the police the french police the ss was paralyzed , mr burrin wrote the french authorities were entirely disposed to get rid of foreign jews , he wrote , referring to the officials offer to the nazis , on that occasion at least , to hand over jews who were not french citizens ms le pen s remark on sunday was criticized as a grave mistake by her principal election opponent , the former economy minister emmanuel macron , and as negationism by a leader on the right , christian estrosi , the president of the d azur region the israeli government also had harsh words , as did french jewish organizations ms le pen s campaign has been oriented around an extreme form of nationalism , and she often criticizes historians and others who bring up the uglier aspects of france s past , as she did on sunday we ve taught our children that they have all the reasons in the world to criticize it , to only see its darkest historical aspects , she said i want them to be proud of being french mainstream candidates on the right have uttered similar sentiments about respecting france s national narrative but the vel d hiv and france s wartime treatment of its jews have generally been to this sort of historical revisionism as the american historian robert paxton has pointed out , france was unique in western europe in that it was the only country to use its own police force for roundups in territory not occupied by the germans ever since president jacques chirac declared in a speech in 1995 commemorating the vel d hiv roundup that france , on that day , committed the irreparable , the question of french complicity and guilt has appeared largely settled , officially at least going back on its word , it delivered those whom it was protecting to their executioners , mr chirac said at the time on sunday night , to quiet the growing polemic , ms le pen tried to place her words in the context of others who have disassociated the vichy government from france itself i consider that france and its republic were in london during the occupation , and that the vichy regime wasn t france , ms le pen said in a news release there again , the historians verdict is different the vichy government initially enjoyed wide support , its functionaries and officials came largely from the prewar bureaucracy , and many went on to have excellent careers in government and business after the war foreign countries , including the united states , maintained embassies at vichy and had cordial relations with it mr bousquet received a suspended sentence in 1949 and had a successful career in business afterward his role and high connections were only belatedly 40 years later , when he was charged with crimes against humanity he was shot dead by a deranged person in june 1993 to isolate vichy from the french population , that doesn t hold up for one second , one of france s leading historians of the period , henry rousso , said on monday you only have to look at the newsreels of the crowds applauding p tain , mr rousso said , referring to the wartime vichy leader , marshal p tain not all of france was at vichy but a part of it was ms le pen s remark was all the more puzzling in that she has worked strenuously to dissociate herself from her party s past , embodied by her father , the party founder , le pen , who notoriously called the holocaust a detail in the history of the second world war nazi collaborators were prominent in the early leadership of the national front in the 1970s including members of the french ss and collaborationist milice , and even a leading official of the french wartime agency , a minor cog in the holocaust by the end of the 1980s , holocaust denial had become a wholesale part of the front s ideology , the historian val rie igounet has written ms le pen has typically distanced herself from that aspect of her party",1.0

the jersey shore over the weekend planned the attacks for months , conducted a dry run just days before unleashing his assault and took inspiration from brother osama bin laden and other international terrorists , according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court on tuesday the man , ahmad khan rahami , 28 , was charged with several crimes , including use of weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use , and the criminal complaint against him outlines how close the attacks came to causing death and even more destruction the bomb in manhattan s chelsea neighborhood on saturday night was powerful enough to vault a heavy steel dumpster more than 120 feet through the air , according to the complaint windows shattered 400 feet from where the explosion went off , and pieces of the bomb were recovered 650 feet away among the 31 victims two more than first reported one had to have multiple ball bearings removed from her body as well as bits of metal from an ear and wood shards from her neck , the complaint says the charges came on a day when it was revealed that mr rahami s father told the authorities two years ago that he feared his son was a terrorist , prompting a review by the federal bureau of investigation that did not find any basis for a fuller inquiry the complaint says mr rahami was motivated by an extremist islamic ideology that he recorded in a notebook he had with him when he was shot and wounded by the police in linden , n j on monday morning before being taken into custody pierced by a bullet and splattered with blood , the journal contains screeds against the wars in iraq and afghanistan in one handwritten message , mr rahami pleads that he not be caught before carrying out his planned attacks my heart i pray to the beautiful wise allah , he wrote to not take jihad away from i beg elsewhere in the notebook , the complaint says , he refers to pipe bombs and pressure cookers as well as to shooting police officers mr rahami writes of killing the kuffar , or unbelievers , and praises terrorist figures , including anwar once al qaeda s leading propagandist , who died in a drone strike in yemen , as well as the soldier in the fort hood shooting , among the deadliest of the lone wolf attacks inspired by al qaeda mr rahami had been meticulously planning his attack since at least june , according to the complaint , acquiring the materials he used to construct his weapons , often via ebay , where he was registered as ahmad rahimi while items like ammo slingshot steelies and electric igniters used for fireworks displays might seem harmless , in mr rahami s hands , they were combined to create tools of potential carnage , the complaint says two days before the bombing in chelsea , according to the complaint , mr rahami recorded video of himself igniting an incendiary device in the backyard of his elizabeth , n j home the lighting of a fuse , the complaint says , is followed by billowing smoke and laughter , before mr rahami is seen entering the frame and picking up the device david patton , the chief federal defender in manhattan , said on tuesday that his lawyers immediate goal was for mr rahami , who remains in the hospital , to appear before a judge so that he can be informed of the charges against him late on tuesday mr patton wrote to the court , asking that mr rahami be given a court appearance on wednesday at the earliest possible time if he cannot travel to manhattan for medical reasons , mr patton proposed a hearing by phone or video conference the complaint leaves unanswered questions about when mr rahami began to harbor such apparent antipathy for the country he had lived in for years and where he had become a naturalized citizen as happened with those involved in cases in orlando , fla san bernardino , calif and boston , federal authorities had looked into mr rahami s life well before he launched his assaults federal agents first became aware of mr rahami two years ago , when his father shared with them his concerns that his son might be involved in terrorism the f b i which had been notified about mr rahami by the local police after a domestic dispute involving the family , said in a statement that it conducted a review checking its databases , contacting other agencies and conducting interviews but the review did not turn up anything that warranted further inquiry , and the matter was closed investigators have not discovered any ties between mr rahami and known terrorist groups , and no one has claimed responsibility for his attacks while the islamic state is usually quick to claim credit for attacks around the world , organizations linked to al qaeda vary widely in when or if they do so one key area of the investigation involves whether mr rahami had help building the bombs or if anyone knew what he was doing and did not report it in all , he is linked to 10 explosive devices found in the region among those mr rahami praises in his notebook , according to the complaint , is mr awlaki , whose lectures and jihadist declarations are widely available on the web so , too , is inspire magazine , which has published detailed instructions for making pipe bombs as well as more sophisticated explosive devices using pressure cookers and christmas lights , the components used in the new bombs despite being killed in a drone strike ordered by president obama , mr awlaki remains a powerful influence on jihadists , especially in the west among his documented admirers were syed rizwan farook , who along with his wife killed 14 people in san bernardino omar mateen , who fatally shot 49 people in an orlando nightclub and tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev , who staged an attack at the finish line of the boston marathon with bombs in 2013 the authorities are also scrutinizing a number of trips mr rahami made overseas , particularly several to pakistan in may 2011 , he made a trip to quetta , according to law enforcement officials , citing customs and border protection records in april 2013 , he traveled to quetta again and did not return until march 2014 , according to information provided to customs authorities by the new york city police mr rahami s wife , asia , who left the country days before the bombing , is now in the united arab emirates she provided a statement to the f b i according to officials , and the authorities are working to bring her back into the country as soon as possible the f b i believes mr rahami acted alone but is trying to speak with everyone who knew him it was unclear when mr rahami married his wife , but after returning from a nearly yearlong visit to pakistan in march 2014 , he was increasingly desperate to get her into the country he was still in pakistan when he emailed representative albio sires , democrat of new jersey , asking for help getting her a visa , the congressman said ms rahami s pakistani passport had expired , and agents at the united states embassy in islamabad discovered that she was 35 weeks pregnant , mr sires said ms rahami was told she would need to wait until her baby was born before she could apply for united states visas for her and the child she eventually came to the united states it was unclear when her visa issue was resolved but in august 2014 , mr rahami got into a fight with his family , during which he stabbed his brother in the leg with a knife , court records show when the police arrived , mr rahami s father told them of his concerns about his son s possible involvement in terrorism the information was passed to the joint terrorism task force led by the f b i in newark officers opened what is known as an assessment , the most basic of f b i investigations , and interviewed the father multiple times they never interviewed mr rahami , who was in jail at the time , according to two law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity the father , mohammad rahami , said in an interview that at the time he told f b i agents about his concerns his son was going through a difficult period two years ago i go to the f b i because my son was doing really bad , o k \? he said but they check almost two months , they say , he s o k he s clean , he s not a terrorist i say o k he added now they say he is a terrorist i say o k one official familiar with the inquiry said that the elder mr rahami , after his initial comments about his son , recanted and said he had spoken out of anger the assessment of mr rahami illustrates the challenges the f b i faces as it solicits information from the public about people who might pose a threat and then must sort through what is credible , while balancing the need to protect the country without overstepping its authority depending on the intensity and urgency of an inquiry , there are three types of investigations the f b i can undertake with varying levels of intrusive techniques the first is an assessment , in which agents use basic techniques like conducting interviews , talking to confidential informers , using physical surveillance and checking databases and public records next come preliminary and full investigations , which can be initiated if agents believe a federal crime has been committed or there is a threat to national security those investigations can involve polygraphs , undercover agents and mail searches both assessments and preliminary inquiries have time limits a full investigation has no such time limits , but does eventually require review and employs powerful electronic surveillance tools , requiring the approval of a court warrant among other things , it allows for the secret interception of international communications like mr rahami , one of the boston bombers , tamerlan tsarnaev , was the subject of an assessment in 2011 and just as with mr rahami , the f b i did not generate any additional leads that would have prompted a more serious investigation the tsarnaev assessment was one of approximately 1 , 000 the joint terrorism task force in boston carried out that year in the orlando nightclub attack this year , the circumstances were different mr mateen , who carried out the deadly assault , had made highly inflammatory comments , which came to the attention of investigators , raising the profile of his case to a preliminary inquiry he told colleagues he had family ties to al qaeda and was a member of hezbollah during the investigation , mr mateen was interviewed twice , and the f b i used confidential informers still , the bureau found no evidence that his statements were credible or that he had ties to terrorism while the federal assessment of mr rahami was closed weeks after it began , he did face criminal charges of aggravated assault and illegal weapons possession stemming from the domestic dispute , according to court records he spent over three months in jail , according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation a grand jury , however , declined to indict mr rahami",1.0

"title gawker is said to be sold to univision in a 135 million bid the new york times author sydney ember text gawker media , whose fierce independence afforded it an unsparing approach to web journalism that influenced news organizations across the internet and the wider media world , was sold to univision at auction on tuesday , giving the freewheeling company an outside owner for the first time since its founding 14 years ago univision bid 135 million to beat out the digital media publisher ziff davis , according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the price had not been made public a bankruptcy judge is to officially approve the sale at a hearing later this week the sale came two months after gawker filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy , a concession to the financial pressure the company faces from a 140 million legal judgment in an lawsuit by the former professional wrestler hulk hogan , whose real name is terry g bollea making matters worse for gawker was peter thiel , the billionaire silicon valley entrepreneur , who acknowledged after the hogan trial that he had funded the lawsuit and was providing financial support for other legal cases against the company univision will not assume the 140 million judgment univision , best known for its television network , has recently moved aggressively to expand its online portfolio , and adding gawker s sites fits with its plans to extend its reach beyond viewers univision bought a large stake in the onion this year and acquired full control of fusion , the news site and cable channel that it started with the walt disney company in 2013 univision also owns other digital media companies , including the root , a site focused on issues in a statement , nick denton , gawker s founder and chief executive , said i am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership disentangled from the legal campaign against the company we could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism univision declined to comment for gawker , the sale is the end of an era founded in 2002 by mr denton , a former journalist for the financial times , the site attracted young journalists who took on articles that traditional media organizations were sometimes reluctant to pursue the company had its critics , who said its sites skirted the boundaries of good taste it initially had only two sites gawker , a news and gossip site that largely covered new york media and society , and gizmodo , a gadgets and technology blog what journalists initially lacked in monetary compensation , they made up for in a kind of industry cachet employees went on to found influential sites like the awl and work at publications like the new yorker and time one thing that has always been true about gawker is that it was an amazing incubator of talent , said adam moss , the editor in chief of new york magazine , which has hired many former gawker journalists he added , to a large extent , the voice that they worked out at the beginning became a kind of template for the way people talk on the web mr denton was known for saying that journalists too often share the most interesting stories they know only with each other at the bar after work , and the company held the value of entertaining readers seemingly above all else over the years , gawker media espoused a gossipy , wry tone that often made much of the traditional media seem the company blogs now include jezebel , which is aimed at women , and deadspin , the sports site but gawker s approach has also been to its detriment mr bollea sued gawker media in 2012 over its publication of a video that showed him having sex with the wife of a friend he has been unable to collect from gawker on the 140 million judgment because of its bankruptcy filing mr denton , who is personally liable for 10 million and jointly liable for 115 million , filed for bankruptcy this month , listing 10 million to 50 million in assets and 100 million to 500 million in liabilities gawker had revenue of 17 8 million for the year through july 21 , according to filings in connection with the bankruptcy it reported 48 7 million in revenue in 2015 and 43 8 million in 2014 mr thiel s battle with the company began in 2007 , when valleywag , one of gawker s blogs , wrote a post saying he was gay i had begun coming out to people i knew , and i planned to continue on my own terms , mr thiel wrote in an in the new york times that was published online on monday instead , gawker violated my privacy and cashed in on it he wrote that he was proud to have contributed financial support to mr bollea s case and would continue to support him until his final victory last summer , after gawker published and then removed an article about a married male media executive who sought to hire a gay escort , the company was thrown into turmoil over disagreement about whether the post should have been taken down two top editors resigned , and mr denton vowed to make the site nicer since the verdict in the hogan case was handed down by a florida jury in march , gawker s typical defiance has been tinged with resignation during a party in july at the box , a burlesque club in lower manhattan , the drinks flowed freely , and so did cheeky jokes about mr thiel and the company s bankruptcy last week , at its offices near union square , gawker held its final party as an independent company it was billed as a affair the wine and beer were gone by 8 p m and the mood was somewhere between reunion and irish wake we have shown with our backs against the wall the kind of character and determination and verve and style that i think we can absolutely be proud of , mr denton told a crowd that had assembled on the large area that has become the company s default gathering place in a week , we re going to know the identity of the company s new owner , and i m hopeful and confident that the parent company that the sites will be under will allow them to thrive in a note to employees , vivek shah , the chief executive of ziff davis , said his company had withdrawn from the auction once we felt the price and terms exceeded our threshold when gawker filed for bankruptcy , ziff davis submitted a 90 million offer for the company a stalking horse bidder , ziff davis would have assumed ownership of gawker if no other bidder had emerged as part of its agreement for being the first bidder , ziff davis will collect a 2 475 million breakup fee it was not clear what the sale would mean for mr denton whether he stays on at univision may not be up to him , and there have been indications that he may be ready to step away in the last year , heather dietrick , gawker media s president and general counsel , has taken on more of a leadership role it was also not clear whether univision would hold on to gawker com , the flagship site that was at the center of the hogan suit under univision , gawker will become a relatively small part of a large company that could work in gawker s favor if it is allowed to operate on its own , without too much oversight from its new parent but univision , which has indicated in the past that it planned to go public , could also reshape gawker in its own image gawker s business was also a draw for univision univision and gawker had been in discussions about a potential investment before the hogan trial , but those talks collapsed",1.0
"title trump inauguration security planners brace for wave of protesters the new york times author nicholas fandos text washington security surrounding the inauguration of donald j trump is proving to be the most challenging in recent history , according to senior officials involved in its planning , largely because of the same forces of political rancor that shaped the race for the presidency on top of the daunting threats to any inaugural ceremony , the three dozen agencies responsible for security at the jan 20 festivities are preparing for the possibility of large numbers of protesters flooding the capital , along with what may be nearly a million supporters of mr trump the agencies are worried about the possibility of confrontations between groups of americans still deeply divided over the election and at a moment when millions of people around the world will be turning their attention to washington at the very least , officials said , protests would put additional pressure on the region s security apparatus to paraphrase tolstoy each inauguration is risky , but each is risky in its own way , said michael chertoff , who was secretary of homeland security under president george w bush and oversaw the department for president obama s first inauguration , in 2009 i can t think of an inauguration that presented more security challenges than this one , mr chertoff said there were , of course , heightened concerns for the second inauguration of mr bush , in 2005 , the first presidential to follow the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 and in 2009 , mr obama s inauguration was the first transfer of power in the era and the first in which an was taking the oath of office mr obama faced a rash of racist threats , as well as concerns about a terrorist plot that ultimately proved unfounded but sent the and top aides scrambling on the eve of his even so , mr obama did not face the kind of large protests expected to greet mr trump when he officially arrives in washington the 2009 crowd of nearly two million people , a record , included few , if any , protesters and did not lead to a single arrest , according to christopher t geldart , the director of homeland security for the district of columbia the national park service , which controls much of the public land in washington , from sidewalks to the national mall , has already seen permit requests from groups hoping to host events both for and against mr trump skyrocket to 23 in typical inauguration years , the agency receives just a handful of requests safeguarding the nation s peaceful transfer of power is no easy task even under the most predictable of circumstances there are few rituals in american public life than the of a new president from the metropolitan police of washington to the national park service to the f b i a vast overlapping patchwork of intelligence analysts , military personnel and law enforcement officers numbering in the tens of thousands will be working to protect the inauguration and related activities in total , more than three dozen agencies spread out across the capital will be working to prevent the occasion from becoming a platform for individuals or groups looking to do harm their work , begun months ago , has taken on a new urgency since election day and will soon include the imposition of a security perimeter around the capitol , the mall and large parts of the city the costs of security alone are expected to exceed 100 million protecting the new president , the thousands of dignitaries who will be on hand and the crowds is the top priority of federal intelligence , law enforcement and military agencies , as it has been at inaugurations since the sept 11 attacks threats , from abroad and from homegrown extremists alike , remain a chief concern , current and former officials said what the intelligence community says publicly is what they say privately , and that is more threats from more directions than ever before , said senator roy blunt , republican of missouri , who is chairman of the congressional committee planning the inaugural ceremony and that just means the capitol police and the security elements need to be more thoughtful and alert than ever to what could happen but this time , security forces particularly law enforcement officers who will be on the ground here are also preparing to confront crowds of americans who are unusually divided and anxious over the election results the priority , officials said , is to avoid the kind of violent clashes that periodically flared up on the campaign trail between mr trump s supporters and those who opposed him , while allowing groups on both sides to carry on with events everybody knows how contentious the campaign was , said mr geldart , the district of columbia homeland security director honestly , what really keeps me up at night around this is the ability for us to just allow folks to come in , express their views and leave safely mike litterst , a spokesman for the national park service , said the agency was actively reviewing permit requests , with a goal of trying to accommodate as many events as possible groups that are granted permits will be spaced out to try to prevent mixing , mr geldart said the largest of those events , the women s march on washington , was granted a permit for about 200 , 000 people to rally and then march in protest against mr trump on jan 21 , the day after the inauguration boris epshteyn , the communications director for mr trump s inaugural planning committee , said the group welcomed the free exercise of first amendment rights as long as it is done peacefully and within all applicable laws , rules and regulations just how many of mr trump s supporters will attend remains unclear the planning committee said it was expecting two million to three million people such a crowd would be a record , though mr geldart said his team had yet to see evidence that would cause it to revise its own estimates of 800 , 000 to 900 , 000 people the security effort will require virtually the full strength of the region s law enforcement agencies , as well as significant reinforcements more than 3 , 200 police officers from departments across the country and about 8 , 000 members of the national guard will be on hand to help with basic crowd and traffic control around the city an additional 5 , 000 active duty service members will be on hand to serve in ceremonial capacities mr geldart said those forces would allow local agencies better versed in crowd management tactics to monitor the protesters and groups , in person and with the help of social media the security planning covers not just inauguration day itself but also a week of public and private events planned to celebrate mr trump s victory , beginning with a welcome concert on the national mall on jan 19 thomas barrack jr a longtime friend of mr trump s who is leading the inaugural planning committee , said each of those events had been carefully negotiated with the secret service and its partners mr trump s personal security was made somewhat simpler when he decided he would stay at blair house , as his modern predecessors have , rather than at his new hotel in washington , as was once under consideration it s their party and we re there to develop the operation security plan to make their party safe , said james murray , the deputy assistant director of the secret service s office of protective operations , which has overall responsibility for inaugural security but by all means it s certainly a kind of thing",1.0

federal agencies that are taking on the initiative the task force will work to find ways to increase jobs , housing and educational opportunities for america s rural communities , and to remove obstacles , such as burdensome regulations , and to improve infrastructure and access to technology the task force held its inaugural meeting in washington , d c and attendees included secretary of housing and urban development ben carson , secretary of energy rick perry , director of the white house office of management and budget mick mulvaney , u s trade representative robert lighthizer , chairman of the federal communications commission ajit pai , and other government officials what we began here today is to lay a fertile seed bed in rural america , where good things can grow , perdue said he went on rural america has been struggling under burdensome regulations , but the leaders we gathered today are willing to work together to turn that around by establishing this task force , president trump showed his commitment to prioritizing the prosperity of the farmers and ranchers of america s heartland , as well as all citizens living in rural communities across this great country guided by the president at the helm , and with secretaries carson and perry , director mulvaney , trade representative lighthizer , and so many others , we are telling rural america that we re here , we re listening , and we re going to help provide you with the resources , tools , and support to build robust , sustainable communities for generations to come when asked by breitbart news why perdue s agency is taking the lead on implementing trump s order , the secretary said the president knows that rural americans aren t enjoying the same economic uptick that the rest of americans are enjoying and that rural communities are represented in every state i think trump saw the usda and the secretary of agriculture as the one to bring these together , perdue told breitbart news the other thing is , i guess with all those members of congress , they all have a certain degree of agriculture in their district and they understand the needs of those communities perdue said it s the one common denominator i think that unites us in many , many ways across america in april 2017 , trump issued an executive order establishing the task force to ensure the informed exercise of regulatory authority that impacts agriculture and rural communities regulations , in fact , were routinely mentioned as something detrimental to rural prosperity , including rules and regulations put into place by the epa that create obstacles for farming and ranching the white house laid out the plan this way while much of the country has recovered from the recent recession , large areas of rural america have not fared as well nationally , 85 percent of persistently impoverished counties are in rural areas , and one in four rural children is growing up in poverty the employment numbers continue to lag , and without connectivity and improved infrastructure widely available , the population in rural america is at its lowest point since 2010 the task force is working to improve quality of life for people living in rural areas , develop a reliable workforce , spur innovation and technology development , and roll back regulations to allow communities to grow and thrive by directly engaging stakeholders to develop an action plan for legislative reforms and regulatory relief , the task force is expected to accomplish a great deal for rural americans president trump has asked for a report with concrete recommendations within 180 days of the task force s creation promoting agriculture and rural prosperity is something that is very important to me since i know how vital energy and electricity are to our rural areas , perry said of his agency s role in the task force at the department of energy , we are ready to do our part to bring prosperity to our small towns and rural communities our bioenergies technology office facilitates private and public partnerships to develop new technologies that make biofuels and our national labs are hard at work developing new ways to use our crops for energy , perry said if you re going to address the needs of rural america , you can t do it one agency at a time , mulvaney said at the event tate bennett , who represented the epa at the meeting , said reviewing and reworking the waters of the united states rule as it relates to the clean water act is a priority for epa administrator scott pruitt he wants to hear from the people who are directly impacted by wotus , and that s rural america , bennett said",1.0
"title colin powell , in hacked emails , shows scorn for trump and irritation at clinton the new york times author michael d shear text washington former secretary of state colin l powell has long been one of the high priests of the washington establishment , staying quiet in this year s raucous presidential campaign while tending to his reputation as a thoughtful officer and diplomat but a hack of mr powell s email this week has ripped away the diplomatic jargon and political niceties to reveal his unvarnished disdain of donald j trump as a national disgrace , his personal peeves with hillary clinton and his lingering , but still very raw , anger with the republican colleagues with whom he so often clashed a decade ago there has been an expectation that mr powell , who waited until the final weeks to endorse barack obama in 2008 and 2012 , would do the same for mrs clinton this year but in one 2014 email released online , mr powell lamented that while he respected mrs clinton , he would rather not have to vote for her , describing the democratic presidential nominee as having a long track record , unbridled ambition , greedy , not transformational the emails make clear that if mr powell endorses mrs clinton , he will be motivated by intense feelings about mr trump , whom he also called an international pariah in the email messages , which an aide to mr powell confirmed were authentic , the retired general who served as president george w bush s top diplomat also accuses mr trump , the republican nominee for president , of having embraced what mr powell called a racist movement when he aggressively questioned the validity of mr obama s birth certificate and his legitimacy to serve as the country s top elected official but the emails , many of which were sent in recent weeks , also reveal mr powell s disapproval of mrs clinton s handling of her email scandal and expose his sometimes unflattering observations of the democratic presidential nominee and her husband in a series of exchanges , mr powell lamented efforts by mrs clinton s minions to drag him into the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server by claiming he had advised her on the issue h r c could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it , mr powell wrote late last month , referring to mrs clinton by her initials i told her staff three times not to try that gambit i had to throw a at a hamptons party to get their attention she keeps tripping into these character minefields in the 2014 email , mr powell , though offering no independent knowledge , alluded in graphic language to coverage in the new york post suggesting that bill clinton had continued to cheat on his wife the emails , some of which were first reported by buzzfeed news , also show mr powell venting about some members of mr bush s administration in one reference to donald h rumsfeld , the former defense secretary , he accuses the idiot rummy of being disloyal to both president bushes in another email , mr powell calls dick cheney , the former vice president , and his daughter liz cheney idiots and a spent force peddling a book that ain t going nowhere mr powell appeared to be angry that nbc proposed that he appear on meet the press with mr cheney and his daughter , who were promoting a book they wrote together in the email , mr powell said the network agreed to invite the cheneys at a later date mr powell s emails appeared on a website called dcleaks com , which had previously posted documents that the site had obtained after hacks into the accounts of prominent democrats and some republicans , including gen philip m breedlove , the former commander of nato forces in europe , and george soros , a wealthy backer of liberal causes it is unclear who operates dcleaks com peggy cifrino , an aide to mr powell , responded wednesday morning to an inquiry about the emails we are confirming that general powell has been hacked and that they are his emails we have no further comment at this time mr powell did not respond to an email sent directly to his personal account in several emails , mr powell suggested that speaking out against mr trump would only add to the attention the republican nominee was getting from the news media responding to a reporter asking for comment , mr powell wrote last month that mr trump is his own best enemy and added i will speak out when i feel it appropriate and not after every idiot thing he says but the emails make clear that mr powell , who also served as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has no intention of supporting mr trump in one with a former aide , mr powell insisted that mr trump should not be elected president no need to debate it with you now , but trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah , mr powell wrote in june , noting the criticism of mr trump by several prominent conservatives he is in the process of destroying himself , no need for dems to attack him mr powell also made clear in a series of exchanges how much he was offended by mr trump s attacks on the issue of mr obama s birth yup , the whole birther movement was racist , mr powell wrote that s what the 99 believe when trump couldn t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a muslim as i have said before , what if he was \? muslims are born as americans everyday mr powell dismissed as completely ineffective mr trump s recent attempts to reach out to black voters , saying that the republican nominee takes us for idiots mr powell said that nothing mr trump could say to black voters would improve his standing , in part because of the things he said about mr obama he can never overcome what he tried to do to obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force obama out of the presidency , mr powell wrote , saying to his aide , you don t fall for his false sincerity , i hope in the emails , mr powell blamed the news media for helping fuel mr trump s candidacy in december 2015 , he turned down a request from cnn s fareed zakaria to discuss mr trump it is time to start ignoring him you guys are playing his game , you are his oxygen , mr powell responded in august 2015 , mr powell predicted that mr trump would take it to the convention in part because news networks were chasing ratings he appeals to the worst angels of the g o p nature and poor white folks , mr powell said in the email in that email , mr powell in part defended mrs clinton s actions in the attack on the american diplomatic compound in benghazi , libya , in 2012 in december 2015 , he told condoleezza rice , his successor at the state department , that the republican political attacks on benghazi were a stupid witch hunt and wrote that basic fault falls on a courageous ambassador who thought libyans now love me and i am o k in this very vulnerable place he added that blame also rests on his leaders and supporters back here , including mrs clinton a few months later , in a discussion about mrs clinton s email scandal , mr powell lamented that everything h r c touches she kind of

not fifteen percent of iowa farmers never intend to retire , according to a 2014 farm poll by iowa state university extension and outreach and the state agriculture department another 20 percent said they plan to eventually continuing to provide some managerial control or labor to their farms many do not have a formal retirement fund the land , they say , is their 401 \( k \) the same fierce independence that drew them to farming characterizes their retirement approach free of pensions , unions and experts , just how they like it we re on our own , mr francois said all you have to do is ask for advice , but we don t only 49 percent of iowa farmers have identified a successor to eventually run their farms , according to the 2014 farm poll many avoid the topic because they equate retirement with mortality they are quick to relay stories of farmers who died shortly after retiring presumably , they imply , because of a loss of purpose even those who have selected a successor are loath to pick a retirement date and actively prepare for it it took a tornado for dean vaske s father , art , to retire and move into town he had been milking cows twice a day until his early 70s then the tornado wiped out another son s farm buildings , prompting art to invite that son to move onto his farm looking back , dean vaske said , the transition was smooth we couldn t have planned it much better , he said farmers here assume retirement will work itself out if everyone s raised right , the next generation will take care of us when we get to the point that we can t farm ourselves , said jim hogan , 66 , a farmer from monticello , iowa , whose father never retired mr hogan has two sons who farm with him and no idea how he will structure his retirement income when he scales back from daily operations yet he admits that his father s lack of succession planning \( the farm was ultimately left in the control of mr hogan s mother when his father died \) was not ideal , limiting what mr hogan and his brothers can now do with the land , which is still owned by his mother in a trust controlled by a law firm david w baker , a farm transition specialist from iowa state extension and outreach , said that when he counsels families to help them begin discussing retirement , 90 percent of his meetings bring someone to tears there are strong feelings about the farm , about what grandpa and grandma did , about my son or daughter having no interest in my farm , mr baker said amanda van steenwyk , who leads a program for the iowa farm bureau , said the scenario can be devastating from the lack of planning , the farm will get split up or even worse , the family will get split up , she said a farmer s retirement is determined by whether an adult child is involved in the operation this is the case for 31 percent of iowa farmers , according to the farm poll , which means they will typically sell or rent the land to their farming child upon retirement arriving at an equitable arrangement for the nonfarming children can be a challenge , experts say meanwhile , there is pressure on the child operating the family farm , said matt hein , 61 , a monticello farmer you re actually working with your father s retirement plan , he said you to go to bed at night thinking , that s a retirement plan for jack kintzle , 73 , a retired farmer near cedar rapids , iowa , the fact that his children chose not to farm made him wistful at first , but ultimately simplified his retirement equation it helped me make a cleaner break , he said now mr kintzle lives off his 700 acres some retired farmers leasing their land and splitting the crop between owner and operator others set up a lease in which another operator pays a fixed price per acre to work the land and keep all of its income last year s average rate was 235 per acre , according to iowa state data but farmers are in no rush , guided by a reversal of conventional wisdom on retirement while many americans fear they could work themselves to death , farmers see their livelihood as their lifeline success does not allow them to quit earlier , it prods them to keep going and they don t envy retirees they feel sorry for them it s sad when people have a countdown to retirement , mr francois said they obviously don t love their job my friend who worked at the postal service had it right down to the hours till he could quit now he spends a lot of time just reading he doesn t get outside as much i don t think he even looks good",1.0

"title trump s wiretapping claims puncture veneer of presidential civility the new york times author peter baker text washington when last they saw each other six weeks ago after the ceremonial passing of power , president trump and former president barack obama parted with smiles and handshakes but it did not take long for the surface bonhomie to degenerate into a fierce and public clash unlike any other in modern times while mr obama has remained quiet for the most part , some of his closest loyalists moved into opposition mode , leading what some only call the resistance mr trump , convinced that obama holdovers still in government are trying to sabotage his presidency , took the conflict nuclear over the weekend by accusing his predecessor of bugging his telephones last year mr trump provided no proof , and the charge was quickly dismissed by intelligence veterans and , indirectly , the f b i but that did not make it any less sensational or any less historic never in recent generations has the natural friction between current and past presidents spilled over into such a public spectacle if sustained , it could fray the institution of the presidency , further erode the public s already low confidence in the nation s leadership and leave both allies and enemies with the impression of an america at war with itself perhaps it should be no surprise that it came to this between the 44th and 45th presidents during last year s campaign , mr obama called mr trump a con artist and a who could not be trusted with the nuclear codes mr trump called mr obama the worst president in the history of the united states after spending years questioning whether he had been born in the united states they put that rancor aside for a cordial meeting after the election , but that barely veiled the chasm between them in terms of personality , politics and policy we re in a unique period , said newt gingrich , the republican former house speaker who has been an outside adviser to the new president trump is a genuinely disruptive figure who threatens everything obama stands for mr obama s camp insisted they are simply defending their legacy it takes two people to duel , and only one seems to be aiming his weapon , said jennifer psaki , white house communications director under mr obama the uniqueness of the time is the fact that you have one unhinged and misinformed sitting president pointing his gun at a former that is unprecedented denis r mcdonough , mr obama s last white house chief of staff , said the former president s team could not remain silent in the face of false assertions what i have witnessed in recent days is former colleagues speaking out against untruths when needed , he said that is best characterized as not backing down from attacks it is not seeking out conflict but inside the trump white house , it has become an article of faith that people seeded throughout the government by mr obama have been leaking everything they could get their hands on to damage the new president i think that president obama is behind it , because his people are certainly behind it , mr trump said in a recent interview with fox friends and some of the leaks possibly come from that group , you know , some of the leaks , which are really very serious leaks , because they re very bad in terms of national security other presidents have endured fractious relations after leaving office , herbert hoover regularly castigated franklin d roosevelt , who ostracized his predecessor harry s truman was so estranged from dwight d eisenhower that they did not speak during a frosty ride to the 1953 inauguration ronald reagan publicly blamed his woes on the mess he said jimmy carter had left him , just as mr obama from time to time pointed the finger at george w bush but none of those moments compared to what america has seen in recent days trump is on new ground in going after obama , said the historian robert dallek , who has written acclaimed books on john f kennedy , lyndon b johnson and richard m nixon most presidents have publicly ignored their predecessors until we get to trump , he added he is either ignorant of recent presidential history or simply doesn t care the closest analogue in modern times may have been johnson and nixon , both presidents who favored secret wiretapping in his last days in office , johnson was furious at nixon after wiretaps revealed that a republican intermediary seemed to be trying to undercut possible peace talks before the 1968 election for his part , nixon was convinced that johnson had bugged him yet neither johnson nor nixon publicly aired those grievances at the time the nixon tapes show that nixon always thought that johnson taped his 1968 campaign , and possibly nixon himself , said luke a nichter , a leading scholar of nixon s secret oval office tapes at texas am university nixon said that it was j edgar hoover who told him this however , based on the available records , the closest to wiretapping nixon that l b j ever came was monitoring the phone calls out of spiro agnew s campaign plane before last year s campaign , mr obama told advisers that he was inclined to keep quiet after leaving office to give his successor a chance to govern , much as mr bush did for him but he expected that successor to be hillary clinton or even jeb bush or marco rubio mr trump was a different story , and mr obama concluded he would speak out if he felt the nation s ideals were under threat ten days into the new administration , when mr trump issued his first temporary travel ban on visitors from seven largely muslim countries and cited mr obama s own actions as precedent , the former president did just that in a statement saying he fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion his team did not wait even that long the day after the inauguration , former obama administration officials , including john kerry , whose tenure as secretary of state had just ended , joined a women s march in washington protesting mr trump other officials appeared on television talk shows and newspaper pages to speak out against the new president s policies mr trump s team has been angered by the criticism but even more by what they see as the enemy within with so few of his own political appointees in place , much of the government is still operating with acting officials , some held over from the obama administration moreover , the federal civil service , while officially neutral politically , is not dominated by trump supporters , judging by vote results in washington and its suburbs so when mark levin , the conservative radio host , contended that mr obama had targeted mr trump for surveillance in what he called a silent coup , an assertion picked up by breitbart news , the former website of the white house chief strategist stephen k bannon , it struck a chord along with reports that in mr obama s last days in office his administration changed the rules on distributing intelligence and made a point of spreading information about mr trump s team and russia to different parts of the government to preserve it , the wiretapping allegation pushed mr trump over the top it s a sign of how deeply frustrated he is , mr gingrich said they have a much bigger assault against them than people have had in the past and so , mr gingrich added , mr trump needs to figure out how to get control of his own bureaucracy he s not going to survive , he said , unless he profoundly rethinks what they re doing and how they re doing it",1.0

, thinking he just wanted to seek the word of god he was handed a bible and a worksheet about that wednesday night s lesson , the parable of the sower , and took a seat next to the pastor he said nothing for nearly 45 minutes , hanging his head and waiting for the 12 parishioners to stand and close their eyes in benediction then felicia sanders heard the first startling boom , she said , as dylann s roof removed a glock handgun from his fanny pack and methodically shot one worshiper after the next , nine in all , starting with the pastor of emanuel african methodist episcopal church , the rev clementa c pinckney before it ended , 77 rounds later , ms sanders , the first witness to testify in mr roof s federal death penalty trial on wednesday , found herself underneath a table muzzling her granddaughter so hard she feared she would suffocate her her wounded son , tywanza sanders , 26 , had already fallen on one side of her her aunt , susie jackson , 87 , lay dead on the other she rubbed her leg in the blood pooling on the linoleum floor so the gunman might think she and her granddaughter were dead as mr roof made his way out of the church that unholy night , june 17 , 2015 , mr sanders moved toward ms jackson , begging for water because he could not breathe when he reached aunt susie , ms sanders wailed from the witness stand , dabbing at her eyes with a tissue , he grabbed a handful of her hair and took his last breath i watched my son come in this world and i watched my son leave this world ms sanders s account opened testimony in united states district court after mr roof s lawyer began to argue for a sentence of life in prison for the avowed white supremacist faced with perhaps his only chance to persuade the jury to spare mr roof s life , the lawyer , david i bruck , used his opening statement to concede mr roof s guilt and suggest doubts about his stability in fairness and in mercy , our society does not invoke the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life , a life in prison , said mr bruck , the leader of the defense team that mr roof plans to jettison during a second phase of the trial , when jurors will decide whether he should be executed we do not behave like the person who committed this crime mr roof , dressed in the striped uniform of the county jail , sat expressionless , staring down at the defense table , as he did throughout more than seven hours in court earlier , the lead prosecutor , julius n richardson , an assistant united states attorney , introduced each of the nine victims , showing the jurors their photographs , describing their lives and explaining how they came to gather in the church s fellowship hall that night but he spent much of his opening statement emphasizing mr roof s deliberateness and premeditation we will prove to you that the defendant s attack was cold and calculating , mr richardson said it was done with malice in his heart , in his mind , racist retribution for perceived offenses against the white race mr richardson told the jury that the prosecution would prove that mr roof was well aware of the historic church s significance to the community and that he intended the attack as a racial call to arms founded in 1818 , the downtown church , known here as mother emanuel , is one of the oldest independent black congregations in the south and played central roles in the plotting of a failed slave revolt in 1822 and in civil rights activities 140 years later ms sanders testified that her wounded son managed to tell mr roof that he did not need to continue shooting , that they meant him no harm i have to do this , she quoted the gunman as responding , because y all are raping our women and y all are taking over our world that , she said , was when he put about five bullets in my son i couldn t move i was just waiting on my turn mr roof is charged with 33 counts , including hate crimes resulting in death , and also faces a death penalty trial in state court that is scheduled for federal prosecutors rejected his offer to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life without parole his victims included mr pinckney , 41 , who was also

back seat police officers and other emergency workers testified wednesday of finding an unimaginable scene footage from a police sergeant s body camera showed them trying to determine the number of casualties we ve got one , two , three , four , five , five , six , seven , eight , make that eight , one officer counted as he surveyed the room mr bruck made no effort to dispute the thrust of the prosecution s case the story mr richardson just finished telling you really did occur , he said dylann roof really is the person the jury of 18 , including six alternates , that was selected wednesday morning consists of 12 whites , five blacks and one who identifies as other thirteen are women and five are men mr roof and his defense team have been at uneasy odds for a month over the lawyers desire to try to save his life by presenting evidence of mental instability after a week of legal wrangling , judge richard m gergel agreed to mr roof s request that mr bruck and his team represent him during the guilt phase but that he represent himself during the penalty phase knowing he would be sidelined when allowed to present evidence of mr roof s family background and psychological history , mr bruck , one of the country s foremost capital defenders , used his opening statement to plant notions that the rampage was the work of a disturbed man on what planet does someone have to be to think you could advance a political agenda by attacking these nine people who are the most kind , upstanding i will use the world noble people you could possibly find in this community or any other , mr bruck told the jury does it make any sense at all and , if not , what does that tell you \? he also tried to focus the jury on mr roof s youth in his only question to ms sanders , he asked if mr roof had said at some point that he was 21 years old he had , she said then she added that mr roof had said he was going to kill himself i was counting on that , she said , glaring at him he is

"title simone biles soars , lifting another country with her the new york times author jer longman text belize city , belize one o clock arrived relatives gathered at a hotel bar to watch olympic gymnastics on television so did the first lady of belize and 11 contestants in the coming miss belize pageant , wearing their sashes and carrying tiny flags but where was simone biles \? the women s individual competition had begun 4 , 000 miles away on thursday afternoon at the rio games biles , 19 , was the heavy american favorite , but there was also anticipation in an unlikely place , the tiny central american country of belize , where she holds dual citizenship phone calls were made television channels were changed beauty contestants were perplexed still no live gymnastics finally , after 30 minutes , the live feed began on caribbean television biles had already performed her vault routine , but the delayed start did not mute the ecstatic cheering that greeted her second gold medal at the rio games there are big stories unfolding in belize , including a supreme court ruling that affirmed gay rights and the cleanup from hurricane earl , which churned through last week but interest in biles also has resonated here , in the country s economic capital , as evidenced everywhere from the prime minister s residence to the shade of a local plum tree , painted purple and gold , where tour guides talk politics and play dominoes we are taking all the gold medals she is going to win , kim simplis barrow , 44 , the first lady of belize , said with a smile biles s connection to belize is as complex and ultimately elevating as the flips , jumps and windmill spins that have made her the best gymnast of her generation , perhaps ever she was born in 1997 in columbus , ohio , to a mother who struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol , and to a father who was not part of her life in 2002 , biles s birth mother lost custody of her four children , who were placed in foster care and faced the possibility of being scattered by adoption instead , simone , then 6 , and her younger sister adria , then 4 , were adopted in 2003 by their maternal grandfather , ron biles , and his second wife , nellie cayetano biles , who is from a prominent belizean family of teachers and nurses and government officials \( nellie is not simone s biological grandmother simone s other two biological siblings were adopted by ron s older sister \) before , ron and nellie were known to simone and adria as grandpa and grandma now they are mom and dad nellie s mother , evarista cayetano , was a teacher and an owner of a grocery store her father , silas cayetano , also began his career as a teacher , then became an official in belize s fishing and agricultural cooperatives , and , later , a senator the original family home , at 118 neal penn road , was made of wood the family lived upstairs and the store was downstairs it was a gathering place , where silas cayetano held court on weekends , settling neighborhood disputes , telling jokes , spinning stories it was community central , especially on saturdays , when the chickens were fresh , said opal enriquez , a cousin of simone s and the director of the miss belize pageant the cayetano home had opened its doors to the nine enriquez children , whose family came to belize city from the southern town of punta gorda silas cayetano had skipped high school , worked at a seminary and passed his teacher s exam at age 19 , relatives said he encouraged his nieces and nephews , as he had his own four children , telling them that education was the most reliable way to escape poverty our uncle set the bar high , enriquez said failure was never an option he embedded in our brains that we were destined for greatness simone listened we weren t afraid to dream when ron and nellie biles adopted simone and adria , they had two sons of their own who were about to graduate from high school and leave for college the couple wanted to travel it would not be easy raising two young girls but the girls needed parents , and adopting them was a no brainer , said nellie , 61 when you grow up , i firmly believe that you see what goes on in the family , what your father and mother do , she said and you tend to mimic what you see it s innate it wasn t even a question the extended biles family is watching simone compete at the olympics across two continents and four time zones ron and nellie and a dozen other relatives are in rio others are in spring , tex north of houston , where the bileses live and own a gymnastics center still more are scattered in belize , new york , los angeles , chicago we re trying to put belize on the map as much as we can , nellie , a retired nurse , said simone is competing for the u s and we re not taking any credit away from that but the fact that she has dual citizenship , i don t see why we cannot celebrate her second country also and belize seems happy to celebrate biles formerly known as british honduras , it gained its independence only in 1981 belize has never produced an olympic champion since it began competing in the summer games in 1968 a small contingent of three athletes was sent to rio to compete with modest ambitions in track and field and judo during the 2000 sydney olympics , belize did have a big moment , celebrating and claiming three gold medals won in sprinting by the american marion jones , whose mother was born here after winning the 200 meters , jones held up a belizean flag its coat of arms features two woodcutters , one with light brown skin carrying an ax , the other darker skinned and holding an oar , who symbolize the country s ethnic diversity , history of slavery and its mahogany industry jones s gesture brought international attention to belize and widely endeared her to its citizens the country later named her a sports ambassador though jones s victories were nullified and her career disgraced by doping and a scheme , which brought a prison sentence of six months , she remains popular and appreciated here belize s national stadium , long being refurbished , is called the marion jones sports complex belize s relationship with simone biles is less entrenched so far , but also less complicated she is a bubbly teenager who has traveled here regularly to visit and to go fishing and snorkeling on vacation last summer , she attended the wedding of her brother here , posed for a newspaper photographer , and was spotted doing back flips off a pier upon arriving in rio , she traded olympic pins with a belizean athlete simone said , when she gets married , it s going to be in belize , nellie biles said ron biles paused as he sat on a sofa at a hotel near rio s olympic park on monday , his 67th birthday it s going to be a while longer , he said as a group of relatives broke into laughter another 16 years as the olympics approached , simone was acknowledged by belize s ministry of youth and sports , interviewed on the popular love fm radio , featured in the country s newspaper and followed widely on social media people are very excited , because she has belizean parentage , she s a great athlete and she acknowledges her belizean roots , adele ramos , the assistant editor of amandala , belize s newspaper , said of biles she is the next best thing for us after marion jones yet some feel conflicted , not about biles , but about the way belize , in their view , does not fully support its homegrown athletes karen vernon , the theater director of belize s institute of creative arts and the mother of two of the country s top cyclists , said she was happy for biles but did not like the fact that belize is waiting for her to win to claim her we need to support our own athletes and artists , vernon said we have talent here the cayetano family was not athletic , nellie biles said the other day with a laugh , though her father did claim ornately to have been a gymnast and the source of simone s versatile skills everybody knows that nellie s father was a comedian , said florita avila , 59 , a cousin of simone s as a girl , nellie biles said she played tennis and did the hop , skip and jump ron , her husband , shook his head you played hopscotch , he said his wife did not play sports but watched them on television , ron added , before correcting himself and saying , you didn t have a television it is a true story , nellie said in 1973 , at 18 , she left belize to attend nursing school at the university of the incarnate word in san antonio until then , she said , she had never seen a television in person , used a phone or flown on a plane it was , needless to say , culture shock , she said in 1976 , she met ron , who was stationed at randolph air force base outside san antonio \( he is retired from the military and from his career as an air traffic controller \) in 1977 , they married , and they have the playful banter of a couple who has been together for 40 years was it love at first sight \? no , oh no , nellie biles said it was his good luck ron replied , she s still here , isn t she \? when the adoption of simone and adria , now 17 , became official in november 2003 , the bileses returned home from meeting with a family judge outside houston nellie told the girls that they could continue to call her and ron grandma and grandpa , or they could call them mom and dad simone has said that she went upstairs , practiced in the mirror , then came down and said mom nellie remembers simone running back upstairs , probably giggling because it seemed funny it was mom from then on i think these girls did more for us than we did for them , nellie biles said simone centralized us as a family we come together and do things and go places because of simone while on a field trip , simone became interested in gymnastics her relatives in belize remember her from those days as little simone , a tiny girl in perpetual motion , a spring chicken and a firecracker and they say she came to possess the same discipline , insistence , confidence and expectation as nellie , the eldest sibling in her own family , who with three partners came to own 14 nursing homes in texas before selling them last year and turning her attention to operating a gymnastics center she is nellie s child all over , said felix enriquez , 47 , opal s brother , who is scheduled to become the second in command in belize s ministry of defense a fair but stern personality always demanding that things be done in a proper way a very big thinker she doesn t think small ron and nellie biles have lived in their current home in spring , tex for six years ron , a native of cleveland , said he had never been in the pool until he jumped in when the cavaliers won the n b a title in june , the city s first major championship since 1964 would he jump in the atlantic in rio if simone won gold in the women s individual all around \? i ll probably just cry , he said nellie said she would watch nervously in the arena , grabbing someone to hold onto here , at the hotel bar , there was little tension , only clapping and cheering except for during simone s wobble on the balance beam i was panicking at that one , felix enriquez said not to worry biles had a huge lead , which she secured on the floor exercise with elegance , strength and the stunning ability to land like a dart oh my god ! simplis barrow , belize s first lady , said , putting her hands to her face , pumping her fists , and photo bombing a family picture woooh she has inspired us all , simplis

"title australian gov t adopts extreme vetting for islamic migrants , reforms foreign worker visas breitbart author neil munro text the australian government has taken the lead from president donald trump in the race to improve vetting of immigrants who may hold hostile islamic attitudes , and to reform programs like the outsourcing visa we re defined by a commitment to common values , political values , the rule of law , democracy , freedom , mutual respect , equality for men and women , prime minister malcolm turnbull told the media on thursday , where he described the reformed vetting process our citizenship process should reflect that so today we are announcing changes to strengthen citizenship , to make for a stronger australia , stronger citizenship , stronger citizen before you apply to be a citizen you will need to have competent english that is a vital requirement also , we need to ensure that our citizenship test enables applicants to demonstrate how they have integrated into and engaged with our australian community , so that they re part of the community they ve lived here as a permanent resident for four years , they speak english , share our values , be integrated those are critically important elements i believe that they will be empowering for applicants this will be good for the applicants , good for the nation , underlining our australian values at the very heart of australian citizenship , australian citizenship is the foundation of our democracy these political values are what bind us together that s what keeps us together in the midst of our diversity the new australian push is a from 2016 , when trump championed immigration reform in the united states , while turnbull sought to stabilize his government after he staged an internal party vote in september 2015 to take the prime minister s job from his own party s leader , tony abbott , an immigration hawk who entirely blocked and stopped a seaborne wave of immigrants from reaching australia to some extent , turnbull s flip towards position is designed to help his wing of the party from abbot s wing of the party , and from the growing support being given to pauline hanson s nationalist one nation party , which is skeptical about islam s ability to integrate into australian society in 2016 and before , turnbull repeatedly endorsed immigration , invited additional refugees , and told the parliament in october 2016 that everyone sitting in this chamber and every australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation the most effective weapon against the muslim terrorists is an inclusive nation amid rising violence and welfare use among immigrant muslims , a september 2016 poll showed that half of all australians want to block muslim immigration , which is strongly supported by business groups which profit from the inflow of extra consumers and workers turnbull s minister for immigration and border protection , peter dutton , told reporters at the press conference that immigrants will have to take an upgraded written test there will be further tests , further questions placed in the test as it currently operates , and there will be the opportunity for people to comment on some of these changes over the course of the next , over the course of the period between now and 1 june so we will consult around the questions around the values issues and we can provide further detail there is also change to be made to the pledge and , again , we ll consult on that particular issue as well so i ll leave it there for example , domestic violence , a perpetrator of domestic violence my view is that that person shouldn t become an australian citizen and we can ask that question but we can also undertake our own checks in relation to police checks or whatever the case might be so that s how you can adopt , apply the test on the 2016 campaign trail , and in his executive orders since his inauguration , president donald trump has called for a new process of extreme vetting refugees and legal immigrants especially muslim immigrants into the united states for example , his january 27 executive order on immigration declared that his policy would be to exclude people with hostile attitudes in order to protect americans , the united states must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles the united states cannot , and should not , admit those who do not support the constitution , or those who would place violent ideologies over american law in addition , the united states should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred \( including honor killings , other forms of violence against women , or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own \) or those who would oppress americans of any race , gender , or sexual orientation the alliance of judges , progressives , and islamic political groups are fiercely opposing any new tests , even though the existing immigration and citizenship process already includes questions and tests designed to exclude people who were terrorists or members of the nazi or soviet communist parties the current immigration document also includes a requirement stemming from the 1775 war of independence which requires immigrant aristocrats to formal give up their noble titles before becoming citizens if u s immigrants lie in their documents , they can be stripped of their citizenship and repatriated for example , u s officials have deported several immigrants who lied about their work for adolf hitler s national socialist party in world war ii u s officials have not said anything about the plans for upgrading the immigration tests and vetting , partly because trump has not yet been able to get many of his nominees confirmed by the senate but homeland security john kelly may be a strong backer of an upgraded test , and told a d c audience on tuesday that we have a sacred duty and that is the continuation of the united states as we know it to protect our way of life and the exceptional people we are australia s reform government has an easier task than trump , who must overcome roadblocks built by progressive judges , media and democratic legislator and democratic legislatures in a federal government for 330 million people in contrast , australia s parliamentary system allows a majority government to easily pass its agenda for the nation of 25 million people throughout the april 19 australian press conference , the journalists and politicians tacitly recognized the problems created by the immigration of islamic adherents who bring their peculiar institutions and values which endorse domestic violence against women , child marriage , female genital mutilation , and reject the authority of what australians describe as secular law for example , one reporter cited several of islam s peculiar practices before asking prime minister , i m not clear why practices such as female genital mutilation , forcing children to marry and what have you , how they re being or could be included in values questions when they re already illegal under australian law what s the need for a values question when it s illegal under australians law , australian law \? that these values in the test aren t really enforceable outside of the law if someone passes a test and says , tick , yes i don t beat my wife tick , i know who cricket player another journalist scoffed at the test , saying these values in the test aren t really enforceable outside of the law if someone passes a test and says , tick , yes i don t beat my wife tick , i know who cricket player don bradman is i m an australian citizen and then they don t express australian values , what happens \? turnbull pushed back , saying but the point is , what the current written test doesn t go to or doesn t go to sufficiently are those questions of values and at the heart , at the very heart of our success is mutual respect respect for each other , respect for people of different faiths and different cultures and respect of women and children that is , you know as i ve , you ve often heard me say this you know , not all disrespecting women , disrespecting women ends up in violence against women but that s where all violence against women begins so this is a very important , very important australian values respect , mutual respect , respect for women and children and that is going to be , that is a key australian value , who would argue with that \? is it reflected in our current process \? no it s not , it should be on april 17 , turnbull announced his party would reform the 457 visa program , which allowed australian companies to bring in foreign workers for skilled and unskilled jobs throughout australia the 457 visa will be replaced by a narrower visa program that will only be used to bring in workers who cannot be found in australia and who can integrate australian society , he said that push is also similar to trump s effort to revamp the unpopular outsourcing program echoing trump s buy american , hire american theme , turnbull said that the goal os his reform is australian jobs for australians first this is all about australians interst , this is about jobs for australians the new program will have a focus on australia s interests , he said we re putting australians first australian workers must have priority for australian jobs , he said this article has been updated with additional information about australia s

the clattering chair behind her , with her owner , orna le pape , in pursuit , yelling bailey , stop ! no ! no ! bailey ran diagonally through the intersection at carroll street then the chair snagged on something bailey broke free , leaving the chair and her leash and id tags behind she turned right at the when in rome hair salon onto her block , president street she ran right past her house , and she kept going ms le pape , 47 and fit but no match for a sprinting dog , lost sight of bailey at the next corner , but yelled directions she went that way ! bailey went left and left again , toward the waterfront when ms le pape got to columbia street , on the far side of the expressway , no one was on the street she screamed bailey s name she guessed at a direction to run she passed people no one had seen her gone every week , dozens of dogs and cats go missing in new york city their distraught owners put up signs some turn up alive some do not over the next few days , bailey somehow became a phenomenon , a cause , and in her rarefied corner of brooklyn and beyond , a social media star now it was around 7 30 on a monday , a school and work day , though ms le pape , a psychotherapist , had no patients scheduled until evening she ran home , got her car and began an aimless , frantic drive in search of the dog she called home and told her son to find photos of bailey \( a dog with a shaggy coat , a chestnut beard and enormously long eyelashes \) and start printing out fliers she drove home , picked them up , walked to a nearby copy shop to make more and started posting them , crying all the while ms le pape canceled sessions with her evening patients , citing a family emergency all day , she wandered the tidy precincts known collectively as brownstone brooklyn up columbia to atlantic avenue , down hicks street by the expressway , west to the factories and warehouses of red hook , swinging by the dog run beneath by the highway overpass everywhere ms le pape went , people seemed compelled to help they asked for an extra flier so they could post it on facebook , or make copies and tape them up elsewhere they offered suggestions call vets , call shelters , call animal rescue places , go to the police i went to the sanitation garage , down by the water , and the guy said , i m announcing this on roll call until they find her , ms le pape said i ran into absolute strangers who said they were going to church to pray for my dog ms le pape spared no expense for 149 95 she registered with lostmydoggie com , which 1 , 250 of her neighbors ,

harlem and east new york , brooklyn nothing more acts of kindness near the fairway supermarket in red hook a man flagged her down he said , i see you re offering a reward on your sign i have the winery that s down here tell people the reward is they can come for a tasting and a tour it is not clear why the search for bailey drew such an outpouring of support part of it may be that carroll gardens retains an intimate feel it certainly did not hurt that she was a particularly appealing dog i don t know if the entire neighborhood would mobilize for an dog , ms le pape said a cynic might wonder if class had anything to do with it a friend of ms le pape s had another theory she said , at a time like this , when there s so much turmoil going on around the election , here s this story that everyone can latch on to and be on the same side everyone wants a lost dog found in the late afternoon , ms le pape s mother noticed signs for a beagle named edie , who lived three blocks from bailey and had also run off while leashed to a chair on the same day as bailey i thought it would be a great idea to join forces , she said she called one of edie s owners , olly smith i can t talk

the vet and had them analyze it \? ms le pape recalled i was reaching for anything ms le pape canceled her wednesday appointments to continue the search we heard you have to do at least a radius , she

"title a chinese mystery who owns a firm on a global shopping spree \? the new york times author michael forsythe and jonathan ansfield text pingyang county s verdant hills still hint at a china rice paddies and villages surround its bustling towns , and in the fields , farmers wade into the mud to plant seedlings as they have for thousands of years it is an odd place to find the people behind a chinese corporate powerhouse that is turning heads on wall street with a global takeover binge yet the area is home to a tiny group of just such people merchants and villagers who happen to control stakes in the anbang insurance group , which owns the waldorf astoria in new york and a portfolio of global names and properties american regulators are now asking who these shareholders are and whether they are holding their stakes on behalf of others the questions add to the mystery surrounding a company that seemed to come out of nowhere , surprising deal makers with offers to pay more than 30 billion for assets around the world anbang s shopping spree is part of an outflow of money from china that has reshaped global markets but has often been shrouded in secrecy , sometimes by prominent chinese looking to shift their wealth abroad without attracting attention at home that poses a problem for international regulators trying to identify the buyers behind major acquisitions and to assess the riskiness of these deals the anbang shareholders in the pingyang county area hold their stakes through a byzantine collection of holding companies but according to dozens of interviews and a review of thousands of pages of anbang filings by the new york times , many of them have something in common they are family members and acquaintances of wu xiaohui , anbang s chairman , a native of the county who married into the family of deng xiaoping , china s paramount leader in the 1980s and 90s in many ways , anbang and mr wu appear to be archetypal products of china s mix of freewheeling capitalism and communist party dominance , a formula that has fueled nearly four decades of untrammeled growth anbang got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004 in the eastern chinese city of ningbo for years it was only a minor player but it took off as it became more aggressive with its finances , buying stakes in chinese banks and bringing in money by selling investment funds to ordinary chinese mr wu , 49 , a former car salesman and antismuggling official , led anbang through this transformation and is now known as one of china s most successful businessmen he wears tailored suits and polished loafers , hobnobs with the likes of stephen a schwarzman of blackstone , and sometimes holds court at harvard but he does not appear in anbang s filings as an owner it is common in china for the wealthy to have their shares in companies held in others names known in chinese as baishoutao , or white gloves , these people are often trusted relatives or acquaintances many defend the practice as a way to protect their privacy in a nation where riches can be a political liability but others say white gloves can be used to hide gains and thwart corruption investigators anbang did not respond when asked if mr wu was a shareholder and declined to answer questions about its owners the company , a spokesman said , has multiple shareholders who have made all required disclosures under chinese law they are a mix of individual and institutional shareholders who made a commercial decision to invest in the company anbang has now grown to be a global company thanks to the support of these shareholders for investors and regulators , white gloves can make it difficult to evaluate the financial health of a chinese buyer ownership may be concentrated in the hands of a few people , posing hidden risks , and companies with government connections could be vulnerable to political shifts or become magnets for corruption it is very important for businesses to know who they are ultimately doing business with , and for investors , what they are investing in , said keith williamson , a managing director in hong kong at alvarez marsal , a firm that carries out corporate fraud investigations it is not clear whether the shareholders in the pingyang county region are holding large stakes on behalf of anyone else but on may 27 , anbang withdrew its application with new york state to buy an iowa insurer , fidelity guaranty life , for 1 6 billion regulators had asked about ties between several shareholders with the same family names , said one person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity a 6 5 billion deal for a portfolio of hotels that includes the essex house in new york and several four seasons locations is awaiting results from a security review by the american government in march , anbang withdrew a 14 billion bid for starwood , the operator of sheraton and westin hotels , in a move that surprised wall street the company could come under greater scrutiny as it prepares to sell shares in its life insurance business on the hong kong stock exchange next year already , at least one major new investment bank has raised concerns about anbang s ownership after studying its shareholding structure to evaluate whether to help with its overseas deals , according to two people involved in the matter who asked not to be identified because the process was private the bank did not participate in anbang s deals separately , the chinese magazine caixin reported in may that chinese regulators were examining anbang s riskier financial products it is unclear where that inquiry stands or whether anbang s ownership structure is being investigated president xi jinping has waged a campaign against graft since taking office , and the use of white gloves has recently come under scrutiny white gloves are accompanied by power s black hands , the communist party s disciplinary watchdog wrote in a report last year questions about anbang s owners come as chinese companies make deals around the world sometimes representing efforts by china s powerful to move money out of the country , as the economy slows and the party tightens its grip on everyday life china has encouraged some capital outflow to improve the performance of its investments and expand its influence but the subject of the elite moving money overseas is politically sensitive , raising questions about the source of their wealth and their confidence in the chinese economy luo yu , the son of a former chief of staff of china s military , said china s most politically powerful families had been transferring money out of the country for some time they don t believe they will hold on to power long enough sooner or later they would collapse , said mr luo , a former colonel in the chinese army whose younger brother was a business partner with one of anbang s founders so they transfer their money at its founding in 2004 , anbang had an impressive list of politically connected directors records show early anbang directors included levin zhu , son of a former prime minister , and chen xiaolu , the son of an army marshal who helped bring communist rule to china then there was mr wu , who was born wu guanghui but was known as wu xiaohui from a young age relatives said he grew up in a catholic family a crucifix sat on his aunt s dining room table , and she wears a necklace with a portrait of the virgin mary mr wu married zhuo ran , a granddaughter of deng , the chinese leader who brought china out of the chaos of the mao era together , mr wu , ms zhuo , mr chen and their relatives owned or ran the companies that controlled anbang , according to company filings anbang leapt onto the global stage with last year s purchase of the waldorf astoria and its aborted bid for the starwood chain by this year , anbang s assets had swelled to 295 billion it is not clear what prompted anbang s sudden interest in overseas assets but the shift came after a reshuffling of its ownership structure that also led to the injection of more than 7 5 billion into the company company documents filed with chinese agencies show that the number of firms holding anbang s shares jumped to 39 , from eight , over six months in 2014 most of those firms received large injections of funds at the same time , anbang s capital more than quintupled ms zhuo disappeared from the ownership records by the end of that year many of mr wu s relatives did as well mr wu and mr chen had disappeared earlier from the records mr zhu , who does not appear to have owned shares , disappeared in paper filings from anbang s roster of directors by 2009 , though he was listed as a director on online government filings as late as 2014 mr wu , mr chen and mr zhu did not respond to requests for comment , and ms zhuo could not be reached in march , mr zhu told chinese reporters that he was not an anbang director anbang s current shareholding firms are not names in china , and some appear to have been set up just to hold anbang shares one lists its address as the empty 27th floor of a dusty beijing office building two more list an address at a mail drop above a beijing post office using corporate filings , the times compiled a list of nearly 100 people who own shares in the firms and traced about a dozen to pingyang county or nearby reporters visited the area , in china s eastern zhejiang province , and interviewed dozens of residents , including several whose names appeared on the list they also interviewed an uncle , an aunt and a nephew of mr wu the latter two , as well as others in the area , said one name matched that of his sister , wu xiaoxia the family members said several other names matched those of mr wu s extended kin , including two cousins and others on his mother s side of the family through their various stakes in anbang shareholding companies , these people control a stake representing more than 17 billion in assets other names matched local acquaintances of mr wu , including huang maosheng , a local businessman who confirmed in a brief phone interview that he had a business relationship with mr wu but declined to elaborate one village leader and neighbors identified the names of four of mr huang s relatives including some whom they described as common workers from among those on the list their anbang holdings represent about 12 billion in assets another resident , mei xiaojing , said two names on the list matched those of her relatives asked if she knew mr wu , she said , well , yes , then ended the phone conversation and did not respond to subsequent calls through multiple holding companies , those three people have a stake representing about 19 billion in anbang assets as anbang rose , so did mr wu s profile in 2013 mr wu secured a yearlong position as a visiting fellow at the asia center of harvard , joining a growing list of politically

"title pat caddell trump white house looks like fort apache under attack by media , political class author john hayward text veteran political strategist pat caddell talked about the american health care act \( ahca \) and its possible effect on the 2018 midterm elections with siriusxm host matt boyle on monday s breitbart news daily all these smart people in washington , who have not understood politics for some time , these are the same people who said , well , it wouldn t hurt the democrats the country will love it , caddell said of conventional media wisdom about obamacare at the time of its passage listen then we had several elections , and now we re saying , oh , of course , the republicans are doomed , he continued , referring to predictions that as many as 20 house republicans could be facing tougher campaigns in 2018 because of the ahca no , they re not it depends on what they do , caddell argued so far , i ll tell you as a fairly competent person , i have no idea what s in this bill that s because , other than the talking points , the headlines thrown out by trump administration and congressional people , i have no clue what s in it i don t know how it answers the problems that have been raised but at the same time , the failure of the republicans and the white house and the entire operation to set a narrative , made important what had to be done to have ceded all of that ground to their opponents on the basis of , well , you know preconditions are going to be hurt , are going to be cut out of this , and we re going to destroy medicaid , whatever to have conceded that ground is to have conceded a lot , he continued but i m not sure the next election is going to be about health care , one way or the other , caddell added it depends on whether or not they can get something fixed , and whether or not people perceive that donald trump has kept his word , or whether this is just seen as another partisan battle so i m not so sure i don t see any great movement in the polls , in terms of party support for either party , since they ve been doing this for several months or raising this i m somewhat skeptical i think the election in 2018 is going to be on much larger grounds than merely a healthcare revolt it may or may not work to donald trump s benefit we will yet see or detriment i think that we re going to see some other things raised but the single most important thing is the economy and what happens to it , he predicted let me just add another thing whether or not donald trump starts representing , in this white house , the voters who put him over the top , he said , criticizing the trump team for failing to show much interest or clarity in using their 2016 election victory to shape a new political majority caddell agreed with boyle that house speaker paul ryan was a major force pushing trump in that conventional republican direction he said ryan was the paramount example of what he calls the chamber of commerce republican establishment party , which was slaughtered in 2016 caddell said those establishment republicans managed to spark an uprising after the victory of the republicans in 2014 and their immediate decision in december to go into conference and sell out everything the republican candidates had campaigned on this group of people has never wanted donald trump they don t want donald trump now the longer he keeps letting them stab him in the back , which is what s happening whether it s on this , it s what s happening at the fcc , on privacy rights , he warned and by the way , where is donald trump taking on the massive disaster of the airlines in this country \? caddell asked nowhere ! they leave so much hanging partly it s because i fear it s because they failed to have an organizing principle of this white house they are then susceptible to their quote allies enemies ! who want to push their agenda , an agenda that the american people have never wanted that is a real danger caddell faulted the trump administration for failing to use the bully pulpit of the white house to influence america s political culture , with the healthcare debate serving as an acute example with a caveat about how polling has become unreliable because much of it is conducted by universities , and university polls can no longer be conducted in a truly unbiased manner , he said he doubted the level of energetic support for the house obamacare replacement bill exceeded 25 percent how did they get in that fix \? and most of all , how did they do it when , in fact , the market , i think , is collapsing \? he marveled part of the problem is there is no place for ordinary people , or even sophisticated people , to go to find out what the truth is all we re getting is propaganda from msnbc and cnn , the mainstream media we don t have enough places for people to go and sort the facts , and it certainly isn t coming out of the house leadership boyle noted the white house could spend more time touting its successes , such as achieving the lowest unemployment figure last month in more than a decade caddell responded that he did not want to start throwing around unemployment numbers he was denouncing as cooked , in the sense that they no longer reflect the real reality of what unemployment is last year those people who cannot get work and whatever , that number is still higher , and we shouldn t repeat the mistake the obama people and the bill mahers of the world made by overemphasizing the importance of the headline unemployment figure this is still not a good economy it s getting better , he pronounced but it s trump s opportunity that , and standing up for people , and shaking washington to its foundations that s why i said something like the airlines the entire reason our airline industry is so much worse than europe is because everyone in washington has been bought off by these people , including those pathetic congressmen i saw question witnesses last week , who complain about their own trips but do nothing about it because they get too much money when he starts draining the swamp , rather than inviting the swamp to eat him , then he will begin to turn this , caddell advised but i have to stay it it s just a true statement this white house has no strategy they could have done things in health care , gotten a bill passed with two things how about dealing with drug prices , and also allowing interstate competition \? just laying a marker down would have been good doing the same thing on tax reform by taking away the hedge fund money , proving he s not going to be the pawn of these big billionaire rich people i mean , trump needs to take charge , he continued they could get successes , but they won t , as long as they allow themselves to be led by their enemy allies boyle suggested some of president trump s problems stemmed from the enormous permanent bureaucracy , which is prone to undermining dramatic reforms he said there were some hopeful signs that trump is beginning to make progress against this obstacle i agree with you , matt it s not lost it s just got to be kind of frustrating because already , things should be happening , said caddell i ll tell you , i don t mean to be just critical because they have done good things , he added and they are surrounded remember , they re at war with an entire political class the white house sometimes looks like fort apache under attack i mean , the indians are everywhere we have a national media that is literally proving itself to be the enemy of the american people , and it will not put out any news that is true or factual that will help trump , he said , accusing the media of banding together in such negativity to undermine him then you have the political class itself , which are the lobbyists , lawyers , money of both the republican party and the democratic party who are united because they so desperately need to go back to normal , to further their corruptions , he added trump needs to strike the high ground this is the most unique challenge a president has ever had he has got to figure the unique ways to do it i think they re capable of it , but so far , somebody needs to tell them they re not doing it , caddell said breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6 00 a m to 9 00 a m eastern listen to the full audio of the interview above",1.0

"title the billionaire who s building a davos of his own the new york times author alessandra stanley text in a conference room at stanford university , a score of scholars , many of them eminent and some from as far away as johannesburg and beijing , gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality the gathering itself had no overt hierarchy , though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others when nicolas berggruen spoke , no one interrupted only he occasionally checked his phone and at dinner , the guests received fruit tarts for dessert except for mr berggruen , who was served chocolate mousse mr berggruen , 54 , is an investor and art collector who was once known as the homeless billionaire because he lived in itinerant luxury in hotels now he is grounded in los angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank , the berggruen institute the institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by bill gates and george soros sean parker , one of the entrepreneurs behind napster and facebook , has a research institute , the parker foundation , which this month pledged 250 million for cancer immunotherapy he is also a of the economic innovation group , which labels itself an ideas laboratory tom steyer , who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager in california , has several environmental nonprofit groups , and last year created the fair shake commission to redress economic inequality there is a generation of new donors who have huge assets , and their own ideas , and think traditional think tanks are said james g mcgann , the director of the think tanks and civil societies program at the university of pennsylvania a think tank that thinks about think tanks in a culture where tweets , not position papers , shape the national conversation , these kinds of are likely to be more influential than we are , mr mcgann said mr berggruen stands out because he is a but player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious a gatsby who shows up at his own parties i am a person who likes to engage in learning , mr berggruen said , in an accent reflecting his parisian upbringing and dual german and american citizenship the next step was to see if i can produce some ideas , he said mr berggruen s investment company , berggruen holdings , is registered in the british virgin islands and his charitable trust is based in bermuda the institute bankrolls several conferences a year , and mr berggruen attends almost every session , takes careful notes and sometimes even appears to dress the part at a dinner for philosophy scholars at the stanford park hotel in march , he wore a dark blazer and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to his sternum , the signature look of the french celebrity philosopher l vy there are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor one of the delights of philanthropy is that it isn t programmed , it is scattershot , with so much room for idiosyncratic choices , said karl zinsmeister , author of the almanac of american philanthropy he cited the example of daniel guggenheim , who championed the rocketry pioneer robert goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot of course there is a high percentage of waste , mr zinsmeister said , but that s how discovery works others worry , though , that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects mr berggruen s institute seems like a of his creation , mcgann said , referring to the world economic forum in davos , switzerland the ascot of conferences for the global elite mr mcgann publishes an annual report on the world s top think tanks , ranking them in more than 50 categories the berggruen institute is not included in any of them mr berggruen happens to be a davos habitu , but his institute has a more eclectic mandate besides philosophy , he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the california budget he has established councils to study european integration and china the berggruen institute will award an annual 1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year it is presently funding six berggruen academic fellowships to china and other places , and it has selected 16 others for the academic year mr berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in brentwood , calif and has commissioned the renowned swiss architecture firm herzog de meuron to design his institute s headquarters craig calhoun , who is leaving the directorship of the london school of economics this summer , was appointed president mr calhoun said his mandate was to deepen the conversation mr berggruen has a gift for networking he knows everyone , said his friend stefan simchowitz , an art dealer at the philosophy conference in stanford , he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with antonio damasio , a neuroscientist who heads the brain and creativity institute at the university of southern california , and reid hoffman , a of linkedin mr hoffman met mr berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned mr berggruen s interests in california governance and

trust mr berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state s budget crisis mr berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige he foots the bills , booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet in workshops , he asks the kind of questions that politicians , intellectuals and billionaires like to answer last november , mr berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in beijing to discuss the future of china upon the group s arrival in beijing , the roads were cleared for their motorcade to the great hall of the people for a meeting with president xi jinping orville schell , a china scholar at the asia society in new york and an adviser to the berggruen institute , said that mr berggruen gained access to chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture , not politics and human rights , and noted that his approach was astute it also helped that mr berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda in some ways he is a thinking man s donald trump , mr schell said he doesn t want anything from anybody , except to be of consequence while mr berggruen has arrived , even in his early days he wasn t exactly an arriviste his father , heinz berggruen , was an art dealer who fled the nazis in 1936 , romanced frida kahlo in new york and befriended picasso in paris the younger mr berggruen

institute has been funded by his charitable trust he says it has a 1 billion endowment foreign status means that mr berggruen forfeits united states tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind american nonprofits in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis , mr berggruen said , he began to question his life s purpose that led him , in 2010 , to hire professors from the university of california , los angeles , to tutor him in philosophy brian walker , a political science professor and expert in chinese philosophy , was one of those professor walker would discuss plato and confucius with mr berggruen over lunch in his suite at the peninsula hotel it was sort of a surreal setting , but he always did the reading and asked good questions , mr walker said i found him a little mysterious he didn t invite personal confidences mr berggruen is courteous and even courtly in restaurants , he stands when his date leaves the table but he isn t a schmoozer his stanford conference ran from 9 a m to 6 p m with little time for small talk at the philosophy dinner , he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the east and west he was playful , but only on topic i am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me , he said , bringing conversation and forks to a halt the west is absolutist , india is pluralist , and china is and i don t mean this in a negative way conformist mr berggruen spoke proudly of the work his think long committee did to address california s deficit , including supporting proposition 31 , which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over 25 million without finding the money for them mr berggruen spent more than 1 million to get the proposition on the ballot the initiative was voted down in 2012 think long was on the winning side , though , of a 2014 measure to make ballot initiatives more transparent kathay feng , executive director of california common cause , which supported the measure , said that she didn t recall the berggruen institute s adding much to policy ideas , but that it did help finance legal advisers and recruit experts i wouldn t say it was deep thinking , ms feng said , but he did bring in some very individuals in 2010 , mr berggruen took the giving pledge which has become a kind of social register for philanthropists joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes but he is not a spendthrift he is a trustee of the los angeles county museum of art , and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum 100 , 000 , the minimum annual gift required many give double that amount , or more , according to two trustees that year , mr berggruen gave u c l a 4 , 750 mr berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking , not just donate to causes his institute , he said , is not just a operation it s an ideas and operation several scholars say that mr berggruen s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed kwame anthony appiah , a philosopher at new york university , said he attended a berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about confucianism , which is not his primary field of study i can t say whether it s the best use of his money , professor appiah said i can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse , and in this case i would have to say , better",1.0
"title how the obama coalition crumbled , leaving an opening for trump the new york times author nate cohn text it is entirely possible , as many have argued , that hillary clinton would be the of the united states if the f b i director , james comey , had not sent a letter to congress about her emails in the last weeks of the campaign but the electoral trends that put donald j trump within striking distance of victory were clear long before mr comey sent his letter they were clear before wikileaks published hacked emails from the democratic national committee they were even clear back in early july , before mr comey excoriated mrs clinton for using a private email server it was clear from the start that mrs clinton was struggling to reassemble the obama coalition at every point of the race , mr trump was doing better among white voters without a college degree than mitt romney did in 2012 by a wide margin mrs clinton was also not matching mr obama s support among black voters this was the core of the obama coalition an alliance between black voters and northern white voters , from mr obama s first win in the 2008 iowa caucuses to his final sprint across the midwestern firewall states where he staked his 2012 bid in 2016 , the obama coalition crumbled and so did the midwestern firewall the countryside of iowa or the industrial belt along lake erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the obama coalition yet it was an important component of his victory campaign lore has it that president obama won thanks to a young , diverse , and metropolitan coalition of the ascendant an emerging democratic majority anchored in the new economy hispanic voters , in particular , were credited with mr obama s victory but mr obama would have won even if he hadn t won the hispanic vote at all he would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004 largely overlooked , his key support often came in the places where you would least expect it he did better than john kerry and al gore among white voters across the northern united states , despite exit poll results to the contrary over all , 34 percent of mr obama s voters were whites without a college degree larger in number than black voters , hispanic voters or whites he excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the pacific coast of oregon and washington to the red river valley in minnesota , along the great lakes to the coast of maine in these places , mr obama often ran as strong or stronger than any democrat in history in 2016 , mr trump made huge gains among white voters it wasn t just in the places where democratic strength had been eroding for a long time , like western pennsylvania it was often in the places where democrats had seemed resilient or even strong , like scranton , pa and eastern iowa it was a decisive break from recent trends white voters without college degrees , for the first time , deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the republicans no bastion of white , democratic strength was immune to the trend for the first time in the history of the two parties , the republican candidate did better among whites than among affluent whites , according to exit poll data and a compilation of new york news surveys according to exit polls , mr trump did better than mr romney by 24 points among white voters without a degree making less than 30 , 000 a year he won these voters by a margin of 62 to 30 percent , compared with mr romney s narrow win of 52 percent to 45 percent in general , exit poll data should be interpreted with caution but polls show a similar swing , and the magnitude of the shifts most likely withstands any failings of the exit polls mrs clinton s profound weakness among northern white voters was not expected as recently as six months ago she was thought to be fairly strong among the older white voters who were skeptical of mr obama from the start most of mr obama s strength among white voters without a degree was due to his gains among those under age 45 but mr trump expanded on republican gains among older white voters , according to upshot estimates , while erasing most of mr obama s gains among younger northern white voters without a degree his gains among younger whites were especially important in the upper midwest young white voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country mr obama s strength among them and mrs clinton s weakness was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries mr trump s gains among white voters weren t simply caused by democrats staying home on election day the clinton team knew what was wrong from the start , according to a clinton campaign staffer and other democrats its models , based on survey data , indicated that they were underperforming mr obama in white areas by a wide margin perhaps 10 points or more as early as the summer the campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012 , and found a large number of white voters who had backed mr obama were now supporting mr trump the same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters those polls aren t affected by changes in turnout the best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data , which will include an account of who voted and who didn t most of this data is only beginning to become available but the limited data that s already available is consistent with the story evident in the polling turnout wasn t the major factor driving shifts among white voters the data in north carolina , where nearly all of the state s jurisdictions have reported their vote , shows that the turnout among white democrats and republicans increased by almost the exact amount about 2 5 percent the same appears to be true in florida nationally , there is no relationship between the decline in democratic strength and the change in turnout mr trump made gains in white areas , whether turnout surged or dropped the exit polls also show all of the signs that mr trump was winning over obama voters perhaps most strikingly , mr trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of mr obama s performance , including 8 percent of those who strongly approved of mr obama s performance and 10 percent of white voters who wanted to continue mr obama s policies mr trump won 20 percent of liberal white voters , according to the exit polls , and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than mr obama s it strongly suggests that mr trump won over large numbers of white , voters who supported mr obama four years earlier the notion that mr trump could win over so many people who voted for mr obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional spectrum mr trump , if anything , was mr obama s opposite but the two had the same winning pitch to white voters mr obama and his campaign team portrayed mr romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs the implication was that he would leave jobs prey to globalization and corporations the proof of mr obama s commitment to the working class and mr romney s callousness , according to the obama campaign , was the auto bailout mr obama protected the auto industry mr romney wrote let detroit go bankrupt in the new york times there was one place where mr romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it coal country there he made big gains after the obama administration pushed policies that would reduce the production and use of coal in retrospect , the scale of the democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of interests mr trump owned mr obama s winning message to autoworkers and mr romney s message to coal country he didn t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy he promised to restore it and make america great again just as mr obama s team caricatured mr romney , mr trump caricatured mrs clinton as a tool of wall street , bought by special interests she , too , would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business , he said according to mr trump s campaign , the proof of his commitment to the working class wasn t the auto bailout but the issue of trade mr trump said free trade was responsible for deindustrialization , and asserted that he would get tough on china , renegotiate nafta and pull out of the partnership two trade agreements that mrs clinton supported or helped negotiate \( she later rejected the deal \) like mr obama , mr trump ran against the establishment and against a candidate who embodied it far more than john mccain or mr romney did the various allegations against mrs clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn t out to help ordinary americans taken together , mr trump s views on immigration , trade , china , crime , guns and islam all had considerable appeal to white democratic voters , according to pew research data it was a far more appealing message than old republican messages about abortion , marriage and the social safety net none of this is to say that changes in turnout didn t help mr trump at all it s just not the reason he made such large gains among white voters there was no relationship between the change in democratic support and the change in turnout , or the change in turnout and democratic strength but the democrats did have a turnout problem in november it wasn t a broad democratic turnout problem it was a black turnout problem the turnout probably increased among all major groups of voters hispanics , white democrats , white republicans except black voters the conclusive data is available in the southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms , and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout in georgia , the black share of the electorate fell to 27 6 percent from 29 9 percent , and in louisiana it fell to 28 5 percent from 30 1 percent , according to the completed state turnout data the data is not yet final in north carolina , but the black share of the electorate looks unlikely to reach 21 percent of voters down from 23 percent in 2012 the data is even less complete in florida , but there too it appears that black turnout will fall by a similar amount perhaps to 12 7 percent of voters from 14 percent in all of these states , the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004 it just wasn t as high as it was with mr obama at the top of the ticket young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline they registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections , causing the black share of registered voters to dip and those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago the data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country , but it tells a similar story turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of philadelphia , while rising everywhere else in the city the turnout in detroit fell by 14 percent turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population , like milwaukee and flint , mich it s hard to know just how much of this is lower black turnout instead of black population decline the census can struggle to make population estimates in places with a declining population but the turnout certainly dropped faster than the reported population decline taken in totality , it appears that black turnout dropped somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent with few exceptions it should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country , regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout , like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo id was the decline in black turnout enough to change the result of the election \? it seems so if black turnout had matched 2012 levels , mrs clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania florida and north carolina would have been extremely close but pinning mrs clinton s loss on low black turnout would probably be a mistake mr obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support \( he would have won michigan , ohio and wisconsin each time even if detroit , cleveland and milwaukee had been severed from their states and cast adrift into the great lakes \) perhaps more important , the clinton campaign s models and public polls all assumed lower black turnout and still showed mrs clinton on track for victory the clinton campaign believed it could compensate for the loss of the obama coalition by winning the rising american electorate or coalition of the ascendant of voters and hispanic voters a caricature of the obama coalition these demographic shifts have benefited democrats over the last decade , but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states this year , the exit polls again exaggerated the importance of and hispanic voters last time , it was said that these voters won the election for mr obama and this time that they lost it for mrs clinton according to the exit polls , mrs clinton fared a tad worse among white voters but much worse among hispanic , and black voters than mr obama and those polls said she didn t win white voters , as many polls indicated but the preliminary upshot analysis of voting returns , census and polling data suggests that mrs clinton was stronger among white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply it is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary they will change over the next few years with more data from the census bureau and additional polling but it nonetheless paints an alternative picture that s more consistent with the actual results , polls and the consensus of academics and campaign analysts on the electorate the upshot estimates suggest that mrs clinton really might have become the first democrat to win white voters with a college degree \( although it is very possible that mr obama did so in 2008 as well \) mrs clinton s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and white voters , much as mr trump s gains were concentrated among the and white voters she gained 17 points among white postgraduates , according to upshot estimates , but just four points among whites with a bachelor s degree there was a similar pattern by income over all , she picked up 24 points among white voters with a degree making more than 250 , 000 , according to the exit polls , while she made only slight gains among those making less than 100 , 000 per year these gains helped her win huge margins in the most and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy , like manhattan , silicon valley , washington , seattle , chicago and boston there , mrs clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the republicans scarsdale , n y voted for mrs clinton by 57 points , up from mr obama s win you could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of boston before reaching a town where mr trump hit 20 percent of the vote she won the affluent suburbs of seattle , like mercer island , bellevue and issaquah , by around 50 points doubling mr obama s victory every republican enclave of western connecticut , like darien and greenwich , voted for mrs clinton , in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction every precinct of winnetka and glencoe , ill went to mrs clinton as well her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent republican suburbs , like those edging west of kansas city , mo and houston north of atlanta , dallas and columbus , ohio or south of charlotte , n c and los angeles in orange county mrs clinton didn t always win these affluent republican enclaves , but she made big gains but the narrowness of mrs clinton s gains among voters helped to concentrate her support in the coasts and the prosperous but safely republican sun belt it left her short in suburbs , like those around philadelphia , detroit and tampa , fla where far fewer workers have a postgraduate degree , make more than 100 , 000 per year or work in finance , science or technology a similar divide may have helped obscure whether mrs clinton improved among hispanic voters , a question addressed in depth by harry enten at fivethirtyeight mrs clinton was expected to excel among hispanic voters , because of mr trump s proposals to deport undocumented workers , his plans to build a wall along the southern border and his inflammatory comments about mexican immigrants the polls generally showed mrs clinton poised to make good on that possibility but the exit polls show a marked decrease in democratic strength , with mrs clinton winning just 66 percent of the hispanic vote , down from mr obama s 71 percent in 2012 mrs clinton plainly fared worse than mr obama in many heavily hispanic areas like south texas or south colorado our estimates suggest that mrs clinton did about the same as mr obama among hispanic voters over all the estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily hispanic areas mrs clinton may have faltered among hispanic voters without a high school degree , while making gains among those with some college education or better nationwide , mrs clinton s success in reviving the elements in the caricature version of the obama coalition really did let her compensate for losses among black voters and whites she won the popular vote but it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states",1.0

"title more women in their 60s and 70s are having way too much fun to retire the new york times author claire cain miller text kay abramowitz has been working , with a few breaks , since she was 14 now 76 , she is a partner in a law firm in portland , ore with no intention of stopping anytime soon retirement or death is always on the horizon , but i have no plans , she said i m actually having way too much fun the arc of women s working lives is changing reaching higher levels when they re younger and stretching out much longer according to two new analyses of census , earnings and retirement data that provide the most comprehensive look yet at women s career paths over all , the paths look much more like men s careers than they used to women are more likely than in previous generations to work at almost every point in their lives , including in their 20s and 30s when they often used to be home with children now , if mothers take breaks at all , it s often not until their late 30s or early 40s and those who leave are likely to return to the labor force most striking , women have become significantly more likely to work into their 60s and even 70s , often full time , according to the analyses and many of these women report that they do it because they enjoy it the data adds a bright chapter to the narrative of women s progress in the world of work even though their participation in the labor force in the united states has flattened in recent years , and as mothers especially face serious challenges , women are working more than ever and getting fulfillment , not just income , from their jobs nearly 30 percent of women 65 to 69 are working , up from 15 percent in the late 1980s , one of the analyses , by the harvard economists claudia goldin and lawrence katz , found eighteen percent of women 70 to 74 work , up from 8 percent this rejection of retirement is more common among women with higher education and savings , though not confined to them those who are not working are more likely to have poor health and low savings , and to be dependent on social security and sometimes disability benefits , ms goldin said of those still working , ms goldin said , they re in occupations in which they really have an identity she added , women have more education , they re in jobs that are more fulfilling , and they stay with them \( ms goldin happens to be an example of the phenomenon , as a professor and researcher \) men s employment after age 60 has also risen , since about 1994 , but not as steeply as women s about 60 percent of men 60 to 64 work , and just over half of women in that age range do the two new studies draw their data from the health and retirement study at the university of michigan and from the current population survey and the survey of income and program participation at the census bureau the data included surveys that tracked the same women over time in some cases , the researchers studied respondents income tax and social security records women now in their 60s and 70s were the first generation to become professionals in large numbers , but that doesn t explain all of the increase in older women who work , which began in the late 1980s for some women , the decision to keep working was unexpected and not necessarily welcome , because of divorce , pension or real estate losses , or changes in social security a recent paper by the economists annamaria lusardi and olivia s mitchell examined women who were working into old age because they had more debt than in previous generations and lacked financial savvy older workers who lost their jobs during the financial crisis were more likely to be unemployed long term especially women , in part because their r sum s tended to be spottier but most of the time , ms goldin and mr katz found , women are working longer because of decisions they made much earlier in their lives to get an education and spend years building a career if people work when they re younger , economists say , they re more likely to work when they re older and because women are marrying and having babies later , they spend more time pursuing careers first that means that even if they take breaks to care of children , they are likely to return to work and to work past a typical retirement age children had no effect on working later in life , the analysis found the same thing is happening among women in their 60s in most developed countries , according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development the most telling discovery here , according to the harvard researchers , was that women who enjoyed their jobs earlier in life were employed longer , independent of their education or earnings when asked if they had enjoyed their jobs six to eight years earlier , 85 to 90 percent of women ages 59 to 63 said they had college graduates are more likely to work into older age of women born between 1945 and 1949 , about 50 percent in all education groups were working at age 64 , compared with 60 percent of college graduates but the participation rates of women without degrees are increasing at roughly the same pace diane tavoian , 64 , left college at 21 and worked hourly customer service jobs in manufacturing , in the military and most recently at the post office she briefly tried retirement at age 61 , but it didn t last long it was just plain boring , she said she is now a barista at starbucks and finishing her bachelor s degree through the company s tuition coverage program the money is nice , of course , but i did it because i found i could not just stay at home , said ms tavoian , who lives in covington , tex i really like the fast pace of it , and i like showing the younger baristas that a frail old lady cannot just keep up with them but pass them by lee ann monfredini , 68 , got her real estate license at age 53 after a career in hospital and nonprofit consulting she was out of the work force for several years when her children were young i feel 40 , said ms monfredini , a broker in san francisco i play bridge once a week and have lunch with women , but i m really not that good at the retirement thing and i love the joy of getting that big commission check there is just one period of life when women are less likely to be working than in previous generations their late 30s and early 40s , according to the other new paper , by ms goldin and joshua mitchell , a senior economist at the census bureau starting with women born in the more worked at ages 25 to 34 than at ages 35 to 44 among women born between 1965 and 1969 , 82 percent worked at ages 40 to 44 , compared with 85 percent of women in that age group who were born decade earlier the decrease in participation is small but noticeable , and is linked to having children the dip is happening later than it once did because people are having babies later , and because the most recent generations of mothers tend to keep working after their first child is born the proportion of mothers who quit after their first birth decreased to 19 percent in the early 2000s , from 28 percent in the 1980s , the new research found they try as hard as they can they don t leave after the first kid or when they re infants or toddlers , ms goldin said they leave later on there are several reasons for that decrease in participation , economists have found the long hours expected in the american workplace inflexibility on where and when work gets done elder care responsibilities and the lack of paid parental leave , work and affordable , child care it s too early to know , but the evidence indicates that even these women are likely to go back to work and to work longer , particularly if they have degrees , ms goldin said helen young hayes managed 50 billion in investments at a mutual fund in denver while raising five children she missed spending more time with them she watched videos of them after they went to bed and five children were a lot of work so , at 41 , she stopped working a decade later , she returned to the work force , starting a corporation to match people with careers the idea grew out of volunteer work she had done during her time away i just have too much energy and too much intensity to not be engaged , said ms young hayes , 54 working for 20 years before she left made easier , she said it gave me the confidence to realize there were no limits to my career",1.0
"title as anger at o reilly builds , activists use social media to prod advertisers the new york times author michael m grynbaum and sapna maheshwari text in this age of rage , madison avenue is finding itself on red alert advertisers are increasingly in the cross hairs of populist activists aided by the power and reach of social media who are demanding that brands quickly take sides on divisive social and political issues , posing a new challenge to corporations that usually prefer to stay out of the fray after a groundswell of online anger over reports that bill o reilly , the fox news host , had settled with at least five women who accused him of harassment , more than 50 companies pulled their ads from mr o reilly s popular prime time program the exodus followed similar campaigns to pressure brands with ties to president trump , like l l bean , uber and advertisers on the new celebrity apprentice americans are now demanding that their brands articulate their values and weigh in on political issues , and i think the degree to which they are expecting that is really quite new , said kara alaimo , who teaches public relations at hofstra university and worked in communications for the united nations , the treasury department in the obama administration , and the administration of former mayor michael r bloomberg what social media is doing is forcing companies to make these decisions much more rapidly ad boycotts are not new provocateurs like don imus and glenn beck lost their cable news soapboxes in part because an angry public used petitions and campaigns to force companies to drop their sponsorship but the culture of social media has accelerated the process to such a degree that corporations may find themselves besieged in hours by tens of thousands of online critics just this week , pepsi was excoriated for a commercial that invoked the imagery of populist protest to sell soft drinks a twitter post from the rev bernice king , the daughter of the rev dr martin luther king jr that mocked pepsi was reposted more than 140 , 000 times within roughly 24 hours of the release of the ad , pepsi pulled it and apologized the rapidity of this cycle has tested even the marketing giants , creating a niche for public relations specialists who say they can help companies navigate these instant social media storms one firm offers software and training sessions that simulate a online attack on a brand the corporate equivalent of war games the boycotts may give brief satisfaction to social media activists but many of the sponsors that turned away from mr o reilly this week are still advertising on fox news , which reaches the biggest audience on cable television fox says it is working with sponsors to address any concerns about the o reilly factor and specialists say there will be little to no financial impact on the network in the near future , though that could change over time brian wieser , a media analyst at pivotal research , said that for now , fox news was essentially just shuffling inventory not unlike if you run a store and have got to figure out what shelf on which you put different products in the short term , the fallout could eat into revenue for the o reilly factor as cheaper commercials replace brands , mr wieser said , while the worry is that advertisers could reassess the annual budgets they spend on fox news even if the effect is more symbolic than financial , there is little question that social media have proved to be potent weapons since november , a twitter account called sleeping giants has pressured brands into removing ads that appear on breitbart news , the conservative news and opinion website with close ties to the trump administration the group , which posts screenshots of advertising on breitbart , says it has influenced hundreds of brands citing kellogg , warby parker and allstate to block ads from appearing on the site sleeping giants , whose proprietors have remained anonymous , extended its mission this week , urging its roughly 81 , 000 followers to post images on twitter of allegations about mr o reilly to a list of advertisers the account has then praised companies that decided to pull sponsorship vulnerability to that kind of online backlash is the flip side of a coin for major brands , which have spent years pursuing consumer engagement on social media these days , big companies may try to talk like teenagers , using slang terms like bae and on fleek on their corporate accounts , or participate in viral trends like the mannequin challenge , an online video craze but social media are also handy conduits for people to register their anger with brands directly and en masse the intensity of this is a lot greater , said matthew hiltzik , a former democratic consultant who draws on his experience in political campaigns to advise corporate clients companies need to invest time and resources in developing proactive strategies that advance and protect the brand , so that they are best prepared to deal with the unexpected weber shandwick , the public relations firm , created a simulation software and training tool called firebell in 2010 to prepare clients for social media maelstroms its website describes a new strain of crisis made up of a string of critical which can gain momentum and mass at firebell , introduced as one facet of responding to a crisis , is now central to the firm s crisis management training , a spokesman said brands are particularly concerned that they can be unaware of where their messages are showing up until angry consumers come calling in recent months , news outlets and activists have discovered prominent companies inadvertently financing a wide range of objectionable material online through automated ad placement , including sites that traffic in fake news and racist and videos on youtube the pressure represents some whiplash for an industry that had broadly moved away from relying on content as a rough proxy for groups of people , focusing instead on targeting online ads , and to a lesser extent , television ads , by audience size , browsing habits and other user characteristics orkin , a company that removed its ads from the o reilly factor , does not buy ads on specific shows but instead purchases broad day parts on networks that reach our target audience , martha craft , a spokeswoman , said the company added mr o reilly s show to a do not buy list after learning of the allegations against him , she said this year , consumers pushed brands to distance themselves from the new celebrity apprentice because mr trump remained an executive producer of the show that effort stemmed from grabyourwallet , a social media campaign that urges boycotts of companies selling products we haven t seen brands almost treated as individuals in this way before , and expected to espouse political beliefs and uphold them consistently across platforms in everything they do , ms alaimo said many companies are still figuring out how to cope with these situations , she said , adding that it was crucial to respond during the golden hour of crisis the term refers to the golden hour in emergency medicine the window after a traumatic injury in which treatment is most likely to stave off death or permanent damage marc s pritchard , the chief brand officer at procter gamble , the world s biggest advertiser , has overseen global marketing for the company since 2008 he said that when he started in the role , one of the first items on his agenda was working with the media team to renew our standards for television and radio ads there were some issues where some of the content was becoming objectionable to a large portion of our consumers , whether it was too much graphic violence , too much either sex or sexual innuendo , mr pritchard said in an interview at an industry conference this week he said that while the media landscape has radically shifted since then , his company maintains the same standards for where its ads should appear i was once told , very early back in my marketing career , your brands are judged by the company they keep , he

"title the guggenheim s greatest hits come roaring back the new york times author holland cotter text of new york city s major museum collections , the guggenheim s is the hardest to see , because so little of it is usually on view blame frank lloyd wright s design , that big empty well of light and air with a little art up the sides not that i object to the building i ve adored it since my first visit as an kid in 1960 , the year after it opened there was art on the ramps then , but all i remember is thinking spaceship still do but now , as if answering a hunger maybe its own to see what that spaceship originally held , the museum brings us visionaries creating a modern guggenheim , a permanent collection show that fills the rotunda the 170 works mostly paintings , with a few sculptures , including a calder mobile dropped from on high add up to a classic display , which could be a snooze , but in this case isn t because a lot of these greatest hits really are great , and some of the less familiar stuff is too the installation is a pleasure neat , clean , linear , up the ramp , with an optional detour into the thannhauser wing \( always permanent holdings turf \) no need to consult floor plans no wandering off course if your visiting time is short , shift into drive , head straight uphill and you ll be done in under an hour the main route , which starts on ramp 2 , is broadly chronological it begins with a landscape by camille pissarro , the hermitage at pontoise , from around 1867 , the collection s earliest work it ends several ramps later , under the skylight , with jackson pollock s big , tarry 1947 alchemy , an archaeological dig of a picture , on view in new york for the first time in 50 years \( after a painstaking restoration that removed decades of grime \) but right off the rotunda floor , before you begin your climb , you undergo a kind of modernist baptism by fire an eruption of color , line and utopian emotion generated by 10 vasily kandinsky paintings kandinsky is the guggenheim s house artist , the one whose work it owns in the greatest depth , and whose spiritualizing sensibility most closely reflects the institution s founding aspirations solomon r guggenheim \( \) a new york industrialist and seasoned collector of old masters , probably never heard of kandinsky until around 1927 , when , at his wife s insistence , he had his portrait done the painter she hired was a german artist named hilla rebay born baroness hildegard anna augusta elisabeth rebay von ehrenwiesen who had recently arrived in new york rebay had strange , figureless paintings and collages , some of which she d made , on her studio walls and she began telling her sitter about wonderful kinds of new art coming out of europe abstract art she called it nonobjective that reached for the spiritual realm guggenheim liked what he heard , and he liked a gamble , and , at age 68 , decided to go with this one the conversion was quick out went the old masters and , under rebay s guidance , in came some zany new ones , kandinsky among them by 1930 , guggenheim , guided by rebay , had bought hundreds of pictures and was inviting people to his apartment in the plaza hotel to see them in 1937 , 80 years ago , he gave his collection institutional heft by setting up the solomon r guggenheim foundation a publicly accessible home for the work the museum of painting followed in 1939 , with rebay as director and 20 years later came the guggenheim museum we have today from an early point , its modernist collection represented the contributions , through sale , purchase or gifts , of several people look at the labels for the 10 introductory kandinskys the names of some of the original owners are noted they , along with guggenheim and rebay , are the visionaries of the show s title two of them , karl nierendorf and justin k thannhauser , were german art dealers who moved to new york before , or during , world war ii another figure , katherine s dreier , was an artist and a private collector with progressive tastes and a vital contributor was family peggy guggenheim , solomon s art addict niece it is around these figures , and their art , that the exhibition , organized by the guggenheim curator megan fontanella , with ylinka barotto , a curatorial assistant , is loosely built thannhauser , an important european dealer in early modern french painting , was the original owner of the pissarro landscape he was pushed by war from berlin to paris and finally to new york in 1941 with no children to carry on his business , he consigned much of his art to the guggenheim foundation , including resplendent gauguin landscapes , seurat pastorals , a cache of van gogh letters and a group of unusually interesting because unusual picassos his compatriot , nierendorf , came to new york on a holiday jaunt in the late 1930s and stayed he was a crucial figure in the developing museum he represented kandinsky in america , and had close ties to paul klee when nierendorf died suddenly in 1947 , the guggenheim foundation bought his estate dozens of works by klee came with it , and seven of them are part of what amounts to a klee that is one of the true highlights of the show rebay loved klee , and bought a gorgeous little abstract grid painting it looks like a dollhouse version of an ardabil carpet for herself like much of the rest of her personal collection , it eventually went to the museum , though her contribution to the institution was already incalculably huge basically , she created it in its early stages and , with her theosophical interests and radical eye , she shaped it in ways that guggenheim on his own might not have \( but even she couldn t sell him on mondrian \) rightfully , many of her own works entered the holdings , and two of her abstract collages are on view vivacious , disciplined , beautiful dreier , an american of german descent , was an artist too she participated in the 1913 armory show , where she met marcel duchamp in 1920 , joined by man ray , they founded the soci t anonyme to buy and exhibit new and difficult art independently wealthy , dreier took collecting as seriously as most people do a profession she made it her career and amassed astonishing holdings the bulk of soci t anonyme material is at yale , but the guggenheim got some treasures a zesty schwitters collage , a mondrian , and a madly complex duchamp ink study of a chess match drawn on what looks like a cocktail napkin the show ends with objects from the peggy guggenheim collection in venice the daughter of solomon s brother benjamin , who died on the titanic , peggy combined the work of several visionaries in one , as an art dealer , a museum builder and a lavish shopper her stated intention was to buy a picture a day with extremely eclectic tastes paintings in the show that belonged to her range from a rigorous geometric abstraction by kazimir malevich to a surrealist tableau by max ernst \( her second husband \) the dominant energy comes from pollock , who was working as a maintenance man at the museum of painting when peggy guggenheim , in a dealer phase , offered to pay him to make paintings full time he did , and she got a lot of them the three at the very top of the ramp are explosive the way the kandinskys are below she claimed pollock as her great discovery , which he was , and still is , though the show yields plenty of other discoveries joseph cornell assemblages , franz marc horses and cows , and splendid things by artists claire falkenstein , perle fine , alice trumbull mason , maria helena vieira da silva you rarely see you may miss them on a quick visit but there s plenty of time to return visionaries will be in place for nearly six months , until september , and even for a collection show , that doesn t sound too long of the 170 pieces in the guggenheim s permanent collection survey , a few stand out paul klee horizon , zenith and atmosphere , 1925 klee and vasily kandinsky both worked at the bauhaus both had mystical temperaments both were artists collected by all the early guggenheim visionaries yet their work was very different , in scale and tone this little klee piece , with its radiant graphic lines and color sprayed from an atomizer , is in an aesthetic and spiritual world entirely its own van gogh landscape with snow , 1888 feeling harassed and jostled by life in paris , in the winter of 1888 van gogh headed south for arles , hoping to find balmy weather and congenial artist friends he found neither arles had been hit by freak snowstorms standoffish locals were the only people around van gogh went to work , and painted a bleak frosted field as oceanic garden franz marc stables , 1913 marc painted some of the most empathetic depictions of animals since d rer s as time went on , his view of the world grew more encompassing and cohesive in stables , his final picture of horses , nature and architecture harmoniously interlock in 1916 , at 36 , he was killed in action during world war i brancusi little french girl , circa for hilla rebay , sculpture , as a medium , wasn t spiritual enough , and this delightfully kooky early brancusi is one of the few sculptures in the guggenheim show influenced by african art that brancusi had studied in paris museums , it ended up in the connecticut living room of katherine s dreier alice trumbull mason emergent form , 1945 an american painter and printmaker , mason \( \) studied in new york with arshile gorky and went through geometric , then biomorphic phases , which she combines in this insouciant piece an ardent nonobjectivist , she signed this painting twice , in different places , to indicate it had no fixed orientation jackson pollock alchemy , 1947 pollock s great painting is a fitting punctuation to the show historically , it feels like both the beginning and the end of something big it s being seen here for the first time in years in more ways than one to get a sense of the extensive conservation work done on it , check out jackson pollock exploring alchemy in the guggenheim s sackler center for

"title islam karimov dies at 78 , ending a long , ruthless rule of uzbekistan the new york times author neil macfarquhar text moscow islam karimov , a ruthless autocrat who ruled uzbekistan for almost three decades , died on friday in the uzbek capital , tashkent he was 78 a joint statement by the cabinet of ministers and parliament announced the death , saying he had a stroke that led to multiple organ failure the announcement followed a long , strange interlude during which uzbek officials refrained from confirming the death even while the leaders of turkey and georgia expressed condolences , mosque leaders were barred from offering prayers for the president s health , and funeral arrangements were being made very publicly a respected opposition website posted pictures of cemetery workers in samarkand , the president s hometown , digging a fresh grave in a prominent location the likeliest reason for the official silence was that top government officials had been unable to decide on the succession and did not want to announce that mr karimov was dead until they could also say who would replace him , at least temporarily the official statement said that the prime minister , shavkat mirziyoev , who is widely deemed to be the president s likeliest successor , would lead the funeral on saturday and that mr karimov would be buried in samarkand in accordance with muslim rites long in poor health , mr karimov had a stroke on aug 27 , ending what was often described as one of the most brutal reigns to emerge from the collapse of the soviet union , exemplified by its continued use of forced labor for uzbekistan s annual cotton harvest the circumstances of his death remain murky the first hint that he was critically ailing came in a government statement on sunday saying he had been hospitalized it gave no other details but in a facebook post , his younger daughter , lola uzbekistan s ambassador to unesco in paris , said he had had a brain hemorrhage on friday she posted a black , blank picture on instagram , saying , he left us i am trying to choose words and don t believe in it myself rumors that mr karimov had died circulated throughout the week the suspicion was that the state was withholding the news while officials addressed the issue of who would succeed him in running the most populous country in central asia , rich in energy reserves and viewed as a strategic crossroads by china , russia and the united states it is by no means certain that prime minister mirziyoev , who is considered a kremlin ally , will succeed mr karimov rustam azimov , a deputy prime minister and finance minister , is a possible technocratic alternative mr karimov s glamorous older daughter , gulnara karimova , had once been seen as having a promising political future , but those prospects disintegrated in a public soap opera involving charges of bribery , money laundering , physical violence and even sorcery mr karimov rose through the ranks of the local communist party until the soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev named him first secretary and effectively uzbekistan s chief in 1989 he won a presidential election after independence in 1991 and used soviet methods to govern the country he is the state and the state is him , and it has been that way for at least 25 years , said steve swerdlow , the director of central asia research at human rights watch power in uzbekistan was concentrated in the hands of the national security service , modeled on the old k g b of the soviet union its longstanding but reportedly ailing director , rustam inoyatov , is expected to wield the greatest influence in the selection of the next president the president s widow , tatyana karimova , an economist , also holds considerable sway neither is known to be seeking a public role it is a police state where the power belongs completely to the security services , said daniil kislov , the editor in chief of a website , ferghana ru the special services will not allow for any alternative on the succession the immediate succession is expected to follow the constitution , which mandates that the head of the senate run the country for three months until new presidential elections can be organized mr karimov repeatedly manipulated elections or referendums to extend his rule well beyond the two terms mandated by the constitution such voting , which critics called fraudulent , always had a preordained conclusion he won his latest presidential term in march 2015 with over 90 percent of the vote mr karimov jailed or exiled his political opponents and muzzled the news media political prisoners were estimated to number in the thousands torture was rife he brushed aside any criticism that managed to bubble up despite the oppression i am one of those who is criticized for staying too long , he said in 2014 but i want to keep working what s wrong with that \? an estimated one million russians still live in uzbekistan , though the population of more than 31 million is overwhelmingly sunni muslim mr karimov , who crushed an islamic insurgency after surviving an assassination attempt by islamic militants in 1999 , was considered a bulwark against the spread of any jihadist threat in the region with him gone , there was some question about whether the islamic state or other groups might try to exploit the transition whether or not the islamic state sees a succession as an opportunity to create risks for the russians remains an open question , said cliff kupchan , an expert on russia and chairman of the eurasia group , a risk advisory firm based in washington in 1999 , mr karimov made his position toward radical islam abundantly clear i am prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people , to sacrifice their lives , in order to save peace and calm in the republic , he told reporters if my child chose such a path , i myself would rip off his head he went on to prove it , massacring hundreds of antigovernment demonstrators in 2005 in the town of andijon , a center of ethnic , social and economic tension in the fertile fergana valley europe and the united states imposed military sanctions mr karimov responded by expelling american forces from military base , an important link in the supply chain for the forces propping up the government in afghanistan against the taliban eventually , supply needs trumped human rights issues , and the united states restored relations , even giving the uzbekistan forces hundreds of surplus armored vehicles as american forces in afghanistan were being drawn down if mr karimov was a gray , reclusive figure , his older daughter and heir was anything but ms karimova , pursuing simultaneous careers in business , diplomacy , music and fashion design , partied with rock stars and fashion designers around the globe yet , from the outset her revealing clothes made her an unlikely leader in a conservative muslim society ms karimova fell from grace in a spectacular manner when , around 2013 , she was put under house arrest and her business ventures were shuttered or confiscated she was under investigation in sweden , switzerland , the united states and elsewhere on suspicion of pocketing bribes and participating in schemes related to selling telecommunications licenses in uzbekistan she and the companies involved have denied wrongdoing opposition websites alleged that mr karimov beat his daughter in a fit of rage before jailing some of her associates and confining her to her home , where she remains incommunicado karimov first slapped her on the face and then really started to beat gulnara , according to an account , attributed to an unidentified security service insider and published in 2013 on the website of the opposition people s movement of uzbekistan ms karimova took to social media at the time to accuse her mother and her younger sister of dabbling in witchcraft the other part of the family destroys and is friends with sorcerers , ms karimova wrote in a post on instagram mr karimov s wife and daughters survive him , as do four grandchildren some analysts attributed mr karimov s reclusiveness and violent tendencies toward opponents as well as relatives and associates he was known to pitch heavy marble ashtrays at senior aides to his early years in a soviet orphanage islam karimov was born on jan 30 , 1938 , in samarkand his official biography said his father had been an office worker other accounts suggested that his parents , overwhelmed by a large family and meager resources , put him in an orphanage , at first temporarily , but eventually left him there he studied to become an engineer , worked at an airplane factory and joined the communist party in the early 1960s he married in 1964 , and he and his wife had a son , petr , but soon divorced the son is believed to have moved to moscow decades ago and never returned mr karimov joined gosplan , the central soviet economic planning agency , in 1966 and married for the second time in 1967 he rose to become the finance minister for the soviet socialist republic of uzbekistan in 1983 by all accounts mr karimov hated the political jockeying by different groups in the initial burst of freedom after independence in 1991 and worked to destroy all autonomous political , media and human rights organizations his antipathy toward islamic groups is sometimes linked to an episode that same year with soviet authority crumbling , islamic vigilante groups had established security and social services that were lacking in the fergana valley , and after one extremist group seized a building , mr karimov went to negotiate with its representatives he soon found himself humiliated when a young religious leader forced him to pray publicly later , he banned mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer over the years , mr karimov also closed off the country to outside observers and put the news media under government control one reason the circumstances of his death remain unclear uzbekistan remained open to tourists , drawn to spectacular mosques and other monuments in silk road cities like samarkand the country was also known as the site of a major environmental disaster the diverting of water from the aral sea for irrigation , especially for the crucial cotton crop , drastically shrank what had once been one of the world s largest inland bodies of water mr karimov never lost his love of soviet methods , be it for strengthening the domestic intelligence services or fostering a centrally planned economy , even if it kept much of the population mired in poverty he once infamously criticized the millions of uzbeks who had gone to take menial jobs in russia just to survive , calling them too lazy to work at home every year , the government forced about one million students and others to join uzbekistan s annual cotton harvest to meet quotas he was a soviet man to the end , mr kislov , the web journalist , said",1.0

states , and by his belief that an upset victory in california could have a psychological impact on convention delegates who already have doubts about mrs clinton but his newly resolute attitude is

democratic convention on saturday while mr sanders says he does not want mr trump to win in november , his advisers and allies say he is willing to do some harm to mrs clinton in the shorter term if it means he can capture a majority of the 475 pledged delegates at stake in california and arrive at the philadelphia convention with maximum political power tad devine , a senior adviser to mr sanders , said the campaign did not think its attacks would help mr trump in the long run , but added that the senator s team was not thinking about the possibility that they could help derail mrs clinton from becoming the first woman elected president the only thing that matters is what happens between now and june 14 , mr devine said , referring to the final democratic primary , in the district of columbia we have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case to make in the upcoming states if we do that , we can be in a strong position to make the best closing argument before the convention if not , everyone will know in and we ll have to take a hard look at where things stand the prospect of a democratic fight is deeply troubling to party leaders who are eager for mrs clinton and house and senate candidates to turn to attacking mr trump without being diverted by democratic strife mr sanders has won nearly 10 million votes , compared to mrs clinton s 13 million , and democratic leaders say she needs time to begin courting the young voters , liberals and other sanders supporters who view her as an ally of corporate and interests but mr sanders has sharpened his language of late , saying tuesday night that the party faced a choice to remain dependent on campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy or welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change mr sanders s instincts have been encouraged by his campaign manager , jeff weaver , who has been blistering against the clinton camp and the party establishment on wednesday , he took to cnn to accuse representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida , the democratic national chairwoman , of throwing shade on the sanders campaign from the very beginning for weeks , some current and former sanders campaign workers have privately acknowledged feeling disheartened about mr weaver s determination to go after the democratic national committee , fearing a pitched battle with the party they hope to support in the general election the intraparty fighting has affected morale , they say , and raised concerns that mr weaver , a longtime sanders aide who more recently ran a comic book store , was not devoted to achieving democratic unity several described the campaign s message as having devolved into a with perceived conspiracies on the part of mrs clinton s allies democratic leaders said they wanted to do everything possible to avoid having tensions send the philadelphia convention into the sort of chaos they had expected to mar the republican convention so far , though , mr sanders has not indicated that he would ask his delegates to support mrs clinton , as she did in 2008 for barack obama i m hopeful that the two candidates will come together , and soon , which could blunt the possibility of real trouble at our convention , said edward g rendell , the former governor of pennsylvania and a clinton supporter who is chairman of the philadelphia host committee for the convention but you look at what happened in nevada , and you worry the melee there , at which sanders supporters revolted and threatened the state democratic chairwoman in a fight over delegates , intensified concerns among clinton allies senator barbara boxer of california , who attended the convention , said she spoke with mr sanders late tuesday and said he was distressed by the nevada episode he will be judged as whether or not he has leadership qualities by the way he handles this , she said senator harry reid of nevada , who is close to mr sanders , spoke with mr sanders on friday about not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight they spoke again on tuesday afternoon , and mr reid complained that a staff member who had attended feared for her safety but mr sanders s subsequent statement condemning the violence , which mostly dwelled on how dismissively he felt the party was treating him , did little to soothe mr reid s unease bernie and i have known each other for a long time , and i believe he is better than this , mr reid said wednesday but some sanders supporters said that democrats were ignoring an undercurrent of anger among those who fear that mrs clinton , if elected , would lack the courage to challenge her friends and political contributors we want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention s agenda , rather than slip back into centrist democratic thinking if she gets elected , said tick segerblom , a state senator in nevada and a sanders supporter i think there could be some chaos at the convention at least outside , with a lot of anarchists , socialists , young people mrs clinton s campaign has largely taken mr sanders s latest broadsides in stride in soliciting donations wednesday , it said that the battle against mr sanders and mr trump was one of the toughest parts of our campaign so far a clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment about mr sanders s debate proposal in california privately , mrs clinton s advisers said mr sanders could win california but emphasized their confidence that mrs clinton would still win the nomination she now has a total of 2 , 293 pledged delegates and superdelegates she needs 90 more to win the nomination , although superdelegates can shift their support up to the convention mr sanders has 1 , 533 pledged delegates and superdelegates mr sanders is now running slightly behind mrs clinton in california in public polls ben tulchin , mr sanders s pollster , pointed to signs of rising voter registration in california among young people and independents two core sanders constituencies as evidence that he could win the state but hispanic registration is also rising , which could benefit mrs clinton with mr sanders expected to campaign aggressively over the next three weeks , his supporters in the state said they were focused on winning the primary , not on november if you want to talk about historic , let s talk about the record turnout numbers at his rallies , said mayor bao nguyen of garden grove , calif a sanders supporter senator sanders isn t obliged to help secretary clinton if she wins that s a decision his team can make if they face that choice senator jeff merkley , democrat of oregon , mr sanders s lone endorser in the senate , said that the party s divisions would only deepen if mr sanders was driven from the race now you can t say to them , hey we don t want to hear your views , and shut the door on them , mr merkley said , and then a month later open the door and say , hey , can you come in and help us out \?",1.0
"title pregnant women turn to marijuana , perhaps harming infants the new york times author catherine saint louis text during her pregnancy , she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette but nearly every day , stacey , then 24 , smoked marijuana with her fianc s blessing , she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop when sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her shifts , she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break i wouldn t necessarily say , go smoke a pound of pot when you re pregnant , said stacey , now a mother in deltona , fla who asked that her full name be withheld because marijuana is illegal in florida in moderation , it s o k many pregnant women , particularly younger ones , seem to agree , a recent federal survey shows as states legalize marijuana or its medical use , expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants but preliminary research suggests otherwise marijuana s main psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc can cross the placenta to reach the fetus , experts say , potentially harming brain development , cognition and birth weight thc can also be present in breast milk there is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use , even in pregnancy , without data to say it s actually safe , said dr torri metz , an obstetrician at denver health medical center who specializes in pregnancies ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use in the federal survey , published online in december , almost 4 percent of said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014 , compared with 2 4 percent in 2002 \( by comparison , roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month \) young were particularly likely to turn to marijuana roughly 7 5 percent of to said they had used pot in the past month in 2014 , compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44 evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers , in pittsburgh and in ottawa , who have long studied children exposed to thc in the womb in pittsburgh , born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading at age 10 , children exposed to thc in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention most troubling , children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading , math and spelling at age 14 than their peers prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly , said dr lauren m jansson , the director of pediatrics at the center for addiction and pregnancy at the johns hopkins university school of medicine several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses , 18 to 22 weeks old , linked to maternal marijuana use in male fetuses who were exposed , for instance , researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala , the part of the brain that regulates emotion even early in development , marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors , said dr yasmin hurd , a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in manhattan those are important for regulation of emotions and reward , even motor function and cognition it is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use , even eventually reducing i q the effects are not dramatic , but that doesn t mean they are not important , said jodi gilman , an assistant professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school who studies adolescent users of cannabis it could make the difference between getting an a and getting a b you could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana , she added the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement but many state and federal agencies avoid the topic of five federal agencies , only the national institute on drug abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last february , according to a study published online in december in the journal substance abuse only 10 state health departments did until recently , the centers for disease control and prevention offered nothing i don t think public health officials should be alarming people , said marian jarlenski , the study s lead author and an assistant professor at the university of pittsburgh graduate school of public health they just have to say , there have been studies done , and there is some risk in a statement , c d c officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to thc in utero while current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent , some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy , such as low birth weight or preterm birth , the agency said dr marie mccormick , a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the national academies of sciences , engineering and medicine , said smoking cannabis does confer , in terms of birth weight , the same risk as cigarettes some of the gathering evidence is reassuring so far , prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects that s why some providers and lay people alike think there s no effect , said dr erica wymore , a neonatologist at children s hospital colorado but she warned , just because they don t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn t mean the baby s neurological development is not impacted most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent marijuana had 12 percent thc in 2014 , while in 1995 it was just 4 percent , according to the national institute on drug abuse all those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels , said therese grant , an epidemiologist and director of the university of washington s fetal alcohol and drug unit we need to do a whole lot more research now there are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use research is often based on reports by pregnant women instead of , say , tests of urine or the umbilical cord and they consistently underreport their use \( researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies \) and pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself few realize that thc is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother s body for weeks , if not months it s not known whether the fetus s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit to find out whether that s happening , dr judy chang , an at the university of pittsburgh , and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana , the researchers found , than to advise them of potential risks when admitted to marijuana use , almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all pregnant women aren t eager to discuss it , either , because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture depression , anxiety , stress , pain , nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of mothers getting federal nutrition help in colorado roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition , said elizabeth nash , a policy analyst at the guttmacher institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy if you re going to consider it like medicine , she said , then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it stacey s son just had his first birthday he s walking , talking and and she isn t worried about his development she still smokes pot indeed , her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf but the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now i don t have to smoke as much anymore , she said",1.0

life as multidevice streaming rapidly evolves into something like the norm , the concept of has started becoming a reality for some viewers it s difficult to find reliable data on how many households have given up cable tv and now get all their television via a streaming like roku , amazon fire or google chromecast i know two couples who have done this one of them had a viewing party on election night last november and hoo , boy , things got interesting when a glitch occurred around 10 p m eastern time \( one thing you should make sure you have before any kind of cable is reliable internet , without which there s no streaming \) in any event , it appears that the situation for many consumers involves keeping cable and shuffling various streaming services so in addition to all the other monthly bills , we are also , in this scenario , forced to keep up with individual fees for streaming services bundling is part of why people opt for cable in the first place , and it s becoming a feature of certain streaming services amazon video is one of several that lets you piggyback various other services , usually at a slightly reduced fee watching tv is more complicated than ever , a pitchman on a broadcast ad for tv guide announced in the 1980s wherever that fellow is now , i bet he s terribly confused with all this in mind , i ve assembled three discrete monthly streaming packages for dedicated movie watchers to consider it s worth remembering that almost all of the services come with free trials and with some notable exceptions , almost all the services offer more than just movies package 1 the mainstreamer its foundational pillars are amazon video \( 8 99 \) and netflix \( 9 99 \) \( for the sake of coherence , i m going to stick to monthly rates , before taxes note that amazon s video service comes with amazon prime s 99 annual fee \) hulu carries more television shows than movies , but it s not light on movies , particularly popular ones unless you like to watch commercials , in which case your hulu will run 7 99 , the desirable option will be version at 11 99 add hbo now \( 14 99 \) starz \( 8 99 \) and showtime \( 10 99 \) that s 65 94 worth of monthly streaming \( explorers of amazon prime will point out that there s a good deal of hbo programming already free through the service this doesn t include movies currently on hbo , or the most recent original programming , including movies this is worth considering when determining whether or not to add hbo now \) but if you want to rent or purchase a film on demand , either a classic or something recently released in theaters , there are also movies available la carte , from 2 99 to 14 99 , available on amazon , vudu , google play , itunes and more let s postulate that each month you spend 2 99 , 4 99 and 14 99 on a single movie from one of these that s 22 97 so the services and a few potentially purchases , you re looking at 88 91 not exactly cheap , but were i to pitch it to you with the proviso less than 100 a month , you might think , not bad package 2 the buff these are or sites that offer cinema of a more artistic , esoteric , possibly obscure bent , and reject american cultural hegemony by , in most cases , going around the world for their fare i d say the foundation would be filmstruck with the criterion channel option at 10 99 a month it s 6 99 a month without criterion , but you ll want criterion , for its smartly chosen array of largely foreign cinematic milestones warner archive \( 9 99 \) is the odds and ends of a great american studio , not a very global concern but still full of enticing options then there s the streaming art house mubi \( 5 99 \) which has , during special promotions , offered enticing yearly subscription discounts \( 34 99 as opposed to 47 99 \) fandor , an eclectic and often exciting service with thousands of movies ranging from martial arts romps such as master of the flying guillotine to expansive , obscure french brainteasers like out 1 , is 10 a month and the solid indie provider sundance now , which also offers original series , is 6 99 that s about 44 a month package 3 the fringe if you like genre movies above all , or like digging for cinematic thrills in obscure but not necessarily arty corners , this might be a good option you ll need warner archive \( 9 99 \) the blaxploitation service brown sugar \( 3 99 \) and the horror specialist screamhouse \( 4 99 \) which runs scary gamuts each with its own menu subheading , including extreme , which has the indeed highly unpleasant cannibal ferox shudder , another horror service \( 4 99 \) recently made waves by offering the controversial ken russell film the devils finicky horror lovers almost immediately protested on social media that it was not the uncut version \( in fairness to shudder , the actual provenance of an uncut version of this movie is highly obscure \) amazon s video service is rife with noir titles in various states of disrepair or restoration a lot of genre stuff in the public domain \( until a copyright owner can effectively yell foul ! \) is on youtube , which is free for the sake of argument , we ll add youtubered \( 9 99 \) to this bill of fare crunchyroll has an membership for 6 95 and the urban movie channel \( 4 99 \) is not as as brown sugar , but it doesn t exactly lack , either , especially when it comes to genre variants like the southern 2009 thriller in the electric mist or the tale the sickle \( 2015 \) total a little over 45 with amazon added as a digging option , a little under 55

outlined in his recipes provide a kind of gateway to culinary excellence , with color and smell and flavor all wrapped together in a magnificent synesthetic whole it was that larger clan ottolenghi was cooking with and for this day , a group of friends who have found their professional and personal lives aligned around a shared enterprise and common aesthetic it was a busman s holiday for people who really like to drive buses there was tara wigley , with whom he collaborates on books and recipes she had offered up the kitchen and garden of her south london home for the feast with her were sarah joseph and esme howarth , two cooks who labor alongside ottolenghi in the atelier he maintains at his headquarters in camden others would arrive later to mix cocktails , grill things , open wine it would be a day of work , perhaps , but one that ended with a grand party i don t see it as a formal thing , ottolenghi said he saw the meal , he said , as a middle eastern take on a proper english garden party ottolenghi spent the previous afternoon shopping , driving through thick london traffic in his prius , checking his usual haunts , stores at which he shops for both work and leisure he went to godfrey s in highbury , the same butcher that supplies his restaurants , for lamb , and chatted amiably with chris godfrey , whose family has run the place since 1905 then he dashed across the street to the serene la fromagerie for cheese he tacked toward his home in camden for verdant herbs and vegetables and luscious yogurt from parkway greens , as he does nearly every day with his sons , and then to kensington high street for pomegranates , fresh almonds and dried rose petals from bahar and zaman , two iranian shops the groceries piled high behind him in the car those groceries took up most of the counter space in wigley s kitchen ottolenghi is a list maker , as anyone preparing a lot of food for a lot of people ought to be , and after he was done selecting platters , he pulled out a folded list of the tasks they needed to complete before everyone arrived wigley , joseph and howarth gathered around him to talk it through it was their menu as much as his , and the discussion that followed was familial and cooperative , less a chef barking orders than a group of friends figuring out how best to tackle a crossword puzzle here again were important lessons for the home cook who aspires to serve a feast do not work alone and as a corollary revel in it choose a menu collaboratively , one in which all the dishes emerge from the same larder , complementing one another , and then cook it collaboratively as well , so that if there is immense bounty on the table when you re done , no one has become exhausted preparing it by noon , the kitchen was humming with activity the lamb , which was now in the oven , perfumed the air with ginger and cumin and cloves howarth blackened eggplants on the stovetop as the first step in creating a kind of deconstructed baba ghanouj , while wigley sliced cherry tomatoes and red onions for a salad she would mix with pomegranate seeds , little hunks of feta and copious amounts of mint , basil and za atar , the middle eastern spice blend generally made of oregano , thyme , salt and toasted sesame seeds joseph , meanwhile , wedged herself into a corner and began to fill a roasting pan with beets and whole heads of garlic she was going to roast them all into softness , then use the garlic in yogurt and place the caramelized beets on top ottolenghi said he wanted to prepare the yogurt i do like to cook , you know , he said the dishes mounted they built a delicate bowl of sliced cucumber and m che it was a taste of spring scattered with mint and cilantro leaves and showered in nigella seeds , with a dressing of yogurt and ginger , garlic and lemon juice that they would dot onto the salad just as it was served there was basmati rice to bake as well , with shallots , garlic , fresh curry leaves and saffron , a surprisingly rich and flavorful combination , a dish that would pair with almost any grilled or roasted meat i ll do it ! howarth said eagerly the four cooks worked together as touring concert musicians might , taking a day off just to jam dessert was complicated the plan was to build what ottolenghi calls a celebration cake , a dessert he serves at catered events helen goh , a longtime pastry collaborator , with whom he is writing a book on baking , was coming to the feast ottolenghi , who trained as a pastry chef at le cordon bleu in london after finishing a master s thesis in philosophy at tel aviv university , wanted it to be perfect for her layers of cake held together not by flour or nuts but by what ottolenghi called the magic of whipped egg whites , sabayon and the chilling effect of the freezer the day before , he made a ganache he also baked the spongy cake layers and put them in the freezer overnight now he needed only to put the cake together , a task he set to with intense concentration , straightening only to examine his work , somewhat critically i think it s best if it is superrustic , he said and here once more was guidance for the home cook this cake was far from perfect the edges of the layers were not flawlessly cut there were cracks across their centers the cream was loosely applied , and the berries on top of it were spread almost and yet they were not the cake looked incredibly elegant when he was finished , ottolenghi gathered the platters and started to fill them again he bent to the job , his back almost parallel to the floor , arranging the food just so , a heron at work it might have seemed precious except that the results far outstripped the time spent achieving them he placed the dishes on a sideboard to await the start of the party food is so horrible , he said you can let it sit out and be beautiful instead the kitchen , already crowded , began to fill with family and friends ramael scully , the head chef at ottolenghi s nopi , arrived and quickly headed toward the grill scully was born in malaysia to parents of chinese , indian , malay and irish descent and raised in australia so i like to burn things , he said when he arrived scully s the man in the family , ottolenghi replied , to laughter ottolenghi s husband , karl ottolenghi allen , followed with their older son , max , who is 3 ottolenghi picked him up and smothered him with kisses , before wigley s three children burst downstairs to take max to the garden sami tamimi , the palestinian chef who collaborated with ottolenghi on two cookbooks \( including the jerusalem from 2012 \) was hard on their heels everyone was hugging everyone else , gossiping and catching up , palming fresh almonds off the counter as snacks a party had broken out and spilled from the kitchen into the garden the whole tableau came together there in perfect light a large , boisterous family bound together by business and love ottolenghi intercepted his son running across the grass adults had started to gather around the table , to seat themselves and pour one another wine let s roll up our sleeves , max , ottolenghi said let s eat a lot of food

"title many insured children lack essential health care , study finds the new york times author marc santora text margo solomon has health insurance for herself and her four children but actually getting treatment is another matter ms solomon , a mother from the bronx , says she has struggled to find a doctor who accepts her insurance and with three of her children coping with asthma , and one with more complicated medical problems , locating a specialist is even more challenging and once in the door , she cannot afford the costs , including for deductibles and medications i feel like i am all alone out here , ms solomon said she is not alone a new study to be released on monday by the children s health fund , a nonprofit based in new york city that expands access to health care for disadvantaged children , found that one in four children in the united states did not have access to essential health care , though a record number of young people now have health insurance the report found that 20 3 million people in the nation under the age of 18 lack access to care that meets modern pediatric standards guidelines issued by the american academy of pediatrics say that all children should get health maintenance visits for immunizations and other preventive services management of acute and chronic medical conditions access to mental health support and dental care and have availability of emergency services and timely access to subspecialists while medicaid and many private insurance plans recommend or require that all of those services be provided , under the umbrella of what is known as the medical home , the study found that millions of insured children are not receiving many of the benefits there are many children with insurance who cannot get primary care and those who do can often have problems getting specialty care as donald j trump , a republican , vows to repeal some , if not all , of the affordable care act , which extended health care coverage to an additional 20 million people , the report s authors worry that even more children could have trouble receiving the care they need the fact that more than 20 million children in the u s experience insurance and noninsurance barriers to getting comprehensive and timely health care is a challenge that needs to get the attention from the new administration , said the report s lead author , dr irwin redlener , president of the nonprofit children s health fund and a professor of pediatrics and health policy and management at columbia university over the past two decades , the number of children without health insurance has steadily decreased to 3 3 million last year from around 10 million in 1997 , according to an analysis of federal data and the federal government s 2015 national health interview survey the effort to extend coverage began 50 years ago with the creation of medicaid , which provides health insurance for the poor it continued more recently with the children s health insurance program , which offers coverage to those who make too much money to qualify for medicaid and , under the obama administration , with the affordable care act , offering subsidized coverage and state exchanges the study relied on census data and reports by federal agencies like the centers for disease control and prevention , prominent medical journals , as well as information extrapolated from the fund s clinics and from its national network of programs that provide health care to underserved children across the country the findings reveal a system in which getting quality care is often confusing and expensive , with even those who benefit from government programs often becoming deeply frustrated for the insured , affordability is still an issue the report noted that health insurance premiums for family coverage increased by 73 percent from 2003 to 2013 employees contributions to the cost of the premiums climbed by 93 percent over that same period , though the rate of increase slowed after the passage of the affordable care act in 2010 the average deductible for an individual with health insurance was 5 percent of median income in 2013 , up from 2 percent in 2003 , the report said the study also cited a survey that found that 59 percent of pediatricians said they had a hard time collecting patients shares of deductibles and from families covered by private health plans for those with medicaid , like ms solomon , difficulties in getting care have also grown many clinics and health systems do not accept patients with medicaid , the study said , because of the low reimbursement rates ms solomon s experience is typical when i was pregnant with my last child , i had such a hard time finding prenatal care , she said she called 15 to 20 doctors before finding one who took her insurance i mean , we would call places and they would be like , we take it , but it turned out they didn t , she said it was so hard even something as simple as getting medicine recently for her son s strep throat was not simple because of a with her insurance card , ms solomon had to cover a 20 for a prescription that should have been free , she said the report said experiences like hers were common , both with government programs and some private insurers the impacts of these barriers are significant , the report said parents faced with financial barriers might seek to save money by calling their doctor for advice , rather than seeing that doctor in person rather than fill expensive prescriptions , a parent might rely on a limited supply of pharmaceutical samples the medical debt incurred by such costs has been linked to reduced access to care , creating a vicious cycle perhaps just as significant are the barriers caused by demographics dr michael kappy , a pediatric endocrinologist at children s hospital colorado just outside denver , has seen the problem firsthand since 1996 , he has traveled in colorado , montana and wyoming to reach children in areas that do not have large medical centers or specialists my focus has been strictly speaking to solving the geographic barrier , dr kappy said the study estimates that around 14 million children live in areas with a shortage of health professionals more than three million residents in new york live in federally designated shortage areas where , among other criteria , there is less than one primary care doctor for every 3 , 000 people the affordable care act sought to address that problem by expanding the national health service corps , but 65 percent of rural areas still have shortages of health professionals dr kappy said one encouraging trend was the use of telemedicine , allowing for patients to be evaluated over the internet , with a local physician assistant aiding with work to expand and improve options , however , the programs need to be properly reimbursed , he said , adding that programs that fund the work of doctors doing outreach to isolated communities were critical dr redlener , the study s chief author , warned that repealing the affordable care act without an adequate replacement could result in more than three million children losing their insurance so far , dr redlener said , none of the proposed replacements will do anything to mitigate what children would potentially lose if the a c a is actually repealed",1.0
"title how to use google to plan your trip the new york times author justin sablich text google maps revolutionized how you get from point a to point b google trips aims to to do the same for how you vacation the smartphone app , released on monday , uses what it already knows about you , based on data it has collected from your gmail account , and combines it with established features from its other offerings , like destinations , and its large database of reviews the goal , as google puts it , is to create a personalized tour guide in your pocket we wanted to reduce the hassle and help travelers enjoy their vacations , stefan frank , the app s product manager , wrote on google s blog the app can do a lot , probably equal to what four travel apps could do , but it can t do everything here s what you need to know before setting off on your first google trip it s \( only if you use gmail \) after setting up the app using your gmail account , you can create your first trip simply search for the destination city and put in your dates if you re hitting multiple cities , you can add those as well if the app has enough of your data , you may already have the trip listed in that case , you do not have to create a new one , just jump into the existing trip and make changes as you see fit the app has complete guides for more than 200 major cities , and each of those has six main features reservations , things to do , saved places , day plans , food drink and getting around there are guides for most other cities as well , but you won t get day plans and getting around options for those smaller locations reservations will show you the flight , hotel and car rental information that it collects from the gmail account you registered with you ll need to forward any reservations made using your work email to your gmail account if you want those to show up it s also worth noting that you cannot make reservations directly from the app it shows only the reservations you already made i had nothing definite planned , but for testing s sake , i tried out a hypothetical trip to boston things to do is a good place to start it recommends destinations broken down by category , from the simple indoors vs outdoors to labels like newbury street shops and ones like selfie spots if you see something you like , hit the star icon and it ll add it to your saved places this breakdown and the ability to save will look familiar to anyone who has used gogobot day plans are suggested themed itineraries for example , historic boston has 10 sites mapped out , each one including all of the information you d see if you found it on google search \( reviews , open and close time \) and the travel time between each stop food drink will give you a basic overview of the area s specialties , and then suggest establishments based on categories like food with a view , cocktail specialists and many more getting around has all the transportation information you could think of you get all of your airport options , from public transportation directions to costs of taxis it s a you ve probably already saved some dough by using the offline feature on google maps you can do the same here by downloading each trip to your phone and all the information will be accessible even if you re not connected to the internet or to cellular service you won t need to eat into your data with google trips , or be stuck if your vacation is in a remote location with no cell service using the app with a data or connection does have a few perks if the weather takes a turn for the worse , the app will suggest indoor activities it ll also show whether a place is open or closed in real time but you re not missing much in offline mode it s customizable if you re strapped for time , the suggested day plans seem to have something for everyone but you can also customize each recommended plan by adding or deleting stops , or create one from scratch the app will also suggest places to visit based on what it knows about you \( which , by now , is a lot \) it had fenway park on the top of my for you list , since it has rightfully concluded that i m a baseball fan then again , boston with kids was another suggested day plan and i don t have any of those it s kind of creepy before you create your first trip , you ll see some of your previous trips that you didn t even share that s because it has already pulled in information from your gmail account , so it knows which hotels you stayed in and where you rented a car from and stores this information under reservations this could be useful if you plan on returning some day but if you d rather not have the stroll down memory lane , you can delete previous trips quite easily it s also not perfect occasional suggestions miss the mark also , i recently returned from a weekend away and it had this week blocked off for me as a trip to new york , which is where i live it s free there is no fine print here as long as you don t consider the fact that google now has a new way of using your data as a price to pay , there is no monetary charge for using the app this is significant if you compare it to similar travel apps like tripit , which costs 49 per year for its premium service",1.0

undergraduate years coincided with the birth of facebook , and the first song cycle benj pasek and justin paul wrote , called edges , was discovered , shared and performed by musical theater majors around the country now , at the age of 31 , after a decade of being touted as promising , and pasek and paul have arrived their first original musical , dear evan hansen , a daringly show that explores the charged interplay between collective grief and social media after a misconstrued high school suicide , begins previews monday , nov 14 and is generating prize chatter even before it opens on broadway dec 4 five days later , their first hollywood movie , la la land , a romantic ryan stone musical fantasia for which they wrote the lyrics , opens that film was the hit of this year s

, obsessive , and , of course , neurotic mr pasek writes words , and mr paul writes music , but they have opted , right from the beginning , to share credit for both elements of their songs they estimate that they spend 350 days a year together , for six to 12 hours at a stretch , sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room , and even sometimes when they are everything that we ve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this , mr paul said during a joint interview at sardi s , surrounded by caricatures of the industry s greatest talents our goal was always , if we could just write songs and tell stories , and get to do that every day , that s our dream a pasek and paul primer six videos to watch although their sensibility is contemporary , they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition , and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop they are not part of the revolution on broadway they have proven especially deft at musicalizing emotional yearning the 11 o clock number in dear evan hansen is a poignant effort by an apologetic single mother \( rachel bay jones \) to comfort her disconsolate son \( ben platt \) in la la land , the climactic song is a stirring recollection by an aspiring actress \( ms stone \) reflecting on inspiration at a casting call i think we re attracted to material that s hopeful and messy , and in that mess , there s an attempt at getting at truth , mr pasek said they are , on the surface , quite different from each other mr paul , who lives in harlem , is a churchgoing christian from westport , conn straight married and the father of a daughter mr pasek , who grew up in ardmore , pa and now lives on the upper west side , is gay , jewish and single but they both began as little boys who loved to sing mr paul , a talented pianist , started early at age 3 , he was singing gospel music with his father , a pastor , in church later , he sang and danced at senior centers with music theater of connecticut and then , at staples high school , he performed in into the woods , conducted the orchestra in hello , dolly ! and spent his free time poring over broadway fake books , which help pianists master melodies mr pasek also sang with a parent his mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song \( she s like a musical theater character , in the best possible way , he said \) she wrote and performed songs from a child s point of view \( they were a big hit on the synagogue circuit , he said \) and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7 mr pasek sang and traveled with the philadelphia boys choir chorale , and then , as a student at friends central school , performed in musicals including bye bye birdie and 42nd street they compare themselves to brothers , who bicker and bond , knowing their relationship will endure a recent fight , over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in dear evan hansen , sent mr pasek stalking out of their columbus circle studio into the street , but then , 10 minutes later , calling mr paul for a lengthy that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over mr pasek and mr paul met the summer before college , at a freshman orientation weekend , and connected over a shared sense of humor , a passion for the work of jason robert brown and an obsession with merrily we roll along \( the title edges alludes to a merrily lyric \) mr pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior , and he recruited mr paul as an arranger and accompanist with that , their collaboration began they mined their own experiences , and those of their friends , for material , acting out songs as they wrote i kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it , said nick blaemire , a fellow michigan student who is now an actor in new york , recalling a night when he told mr pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend , and seeing that become i hmm you raised in the digital age , and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity , they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work at first with cds and a homespun tour of edges , and more recently with producers , performers and journalists that has served them well they re salesmen , and always have been they know how to explain what they re doing and why they re doing it , mr blaemire said michael gracey , the director of the greatest showman , had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film , but , as he talked with mr pasek and mr paul about the movie , abandoned that plan to give them all the work he even videotaped their songwriting sessions , convinced that they would be of significance for posterity i can t even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film , he said the director of la la land , damien chazelle , had a similar experience he was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by justin hurwitz when mr pasek and mr paul , seeking the gig , gave him proposed lyrics for a song called city of stars that became a signature number it was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys , and we brought them on right away , mr chazelle said their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together brent wagner , the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the university of michigan , still remembers the night in 2005 when mr blaemire , then a junior , persuaded him to stop by the kerrytown concert house in ann arbor to see edges it was a youthful work , and it wasn t completely advanced there wasn t even music written down but it was marvelous , and at that moment , you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft , mr wagner said by the time they left school , he said , we knew it would just be a matter of time jeff marx , the tony of avenue q , was equally convinced so sure that he placed a bet on them a michigan alumnus , he had taken on mr pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005 \( i looked at his friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid \) the next year , when mr pasek asked to return , mr marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with mr paul mr paul couldn t afford to write full time he needed to earn money for school but mr marx was so intent that he offered to give mr paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job then , when mr paul said he was unwilling to accept charity , mr marx repositioned his offer as a wager , staking him 7 , 000 , to be repaid only if mr pasek and mr paul made it to broadway within the next decade it happened , but in an unexpected way they had a frustrating experience adapting the roald dahl children s book james and the giant peach , which was mounted at goodspeed musicals in 2010 , and has been revised since they remain proud of their songs , and the show is still being produced at small theaters , but the dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation their musical version of the 1991 film dogfight was presented at second stage , off broadway , in 2012 , and was generally admired , but not well enough to make the leap to broadway but after the initial songwriter for the adaptation of the 1983 family film a christmas story was let go , they were brought in and nominated for a tony award when the show , which was developed to tour , ended up transferring to broadway in 2012 six years after mr marx s bet , mr paul handed him a check at the opening night party my money was safe , mr marx said other mentors have stepped in , too stephen schwartz , the writer of pippin and wicked , has been advising them since mr paul met him as an undergraduate mr schwartz recommended them to lynn ahrens and stephen flaherty \( ragtime \) who admitted them to a dramatists guild fellowship ms ahrens and mr flaherty assigned them to observe the development of next to normal , where they met the director michael greif \( best known for rent \) who is now directing dear evan hansen the new show was borne from an observation mr pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly he noted the desire of many , including himself , to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well mr pasek and mr paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer , stacey mindich , who had helped commission dogfight , offered to finance their dream project she introduced them to the work of a playwright , steven levenson , who became the dear evan hansen book writer , turning their musings into a narrative the show , developed through productions last year at arena stage in washington and this year off broadway at second stage , features a performance by the mr platt \( pitch perfect \) as a high school student he had discovered pasek and paul via youtube , and sang one of the edges songs at a senior concert \( mr platt is not the only pasek and paul fan in his family his father , marc platt , is the producer of la la land and snow white \) the duo s work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers , but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents the insight they seem to have into the heart of a mother has been there as long as i ve known them , said ms jones , who has played pasek and paul mothers in a christmas story and dear evan hansen they use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words a lyric about a ninja turtle or glow stars on the ceiling , she said , referring to a song that was used during the early stages of dear evan hansen both ms jones and mr platt distinctly remember the day mr pasek and mr paul brought in a new song , so small , in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his character s childhood it makes you die inside because it s so real , she said mr platt agreed everybody was a big wreck as they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie , mr pasek and mr paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence they have been working on dear evan hansen for six years , they finished writing songs for trolls and la la land more than a year ago , and they haven t yet begun work on snow white but still on one particularly busy recent day , they started in dumbo , brooklyn , at 8 30 a m for a greatest showman script meeting traveled to midtown to tweak dear evan hansen arrangements with their orchestrator , alex lacamoire split up so mr paul could go to a chelsea studio to record tracks for showman while mr pasek sat in on auditions for mr platt s understudy went to moma for a screening of la la land hosted by jennifer lawrence and then to an at the rainbow room s bar sixtyfive most days aren t nearly that varied or that glamorous and at the start of each project , it is still the two of them , trying to figure out how to tell a story through music nothing changes the next time we have to write a song we re going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be , mr paul said mr pasek jumped in , finishing the thought facing the blank page doesn t get any easier",1.0
"title want to see hamilton in a city near you \? buy a subscription and wait two years the new york times author michael paulson text hamilton is about to hit the road and , more than a year before it arrives in many cities , theaters around the country are trying to convert the hunger for tickets into subscriptions and memberships in many cities , theaters are encouraging potential patrons to subscribe to their seasons , even though hamilton won t arrive until the following season , with the promise that those who subscribe now and then renew will be guaranteed hamilton tickets and can lock in their chosen subscription seats the strategy is because the theaters acknowledge that some tickets will ultimately be available for sale to nonsubscribers given the widespread publicity over the scarcity of tickets to the broadway production of hamilton , though , many theatergoers appear unwilling to risk facing a show in their hometowns in my 38 years of being involved with selling tickets for various activities , i don t believe there has ever been this kind of but how do i get conversation , said deborah f rutter , the president of the john f kennedy center for the performing arts in washington hamilton is scheduled to be at the kennedy center for 14 weeks in the summer of 2018 on wednesday , the center started selling tickets for its season , with the promise that anyone who subscribes that season , and renews next , will be guaranteed tickets the effort to goad people into subscribing for two years to get tickets to the show prompted criticism in the washington post from a blogger , who called it a quite high entrance fee , and from a letter writer , who criticized what she called extortionist prices ms rutter said there would be tickets available for purchase to nonsubscribers , but that it only made sense to reach out to try to bolster subscriptions first people have accused us of gouging , but it s not gouging if you want to be first in line , the best way to do that is to be a subscriber , ms rutter said the strategy is already proving a significant boon to theaters where hamilton will be staged some are nonprofits , and some are commercial enterprises , but all depend on subscriptions or memberships as important elements of their budgets many arts groups have hard times sustaining subscription bases as consumers gravitate toward more la carte and planning for their cultural activities we live and breathe by the subscription model , said lauren reid , chief executive of the theater unit at key brand entertainment , which brings shows to 40 stages in north america through its broadway across america subsidiary ms reid said she had never seen as high a level of consumer awareness about a new show as for hamilton consequently , she added , every theater expecting hamilton is teasing it early to promote subscriptions the bottom line is hamilton is really good for our industry , she said it s an event , and it s a cultural moment , and it s unusual that we have an opportunity like this to highlight something special the tactic is working in chicago , the first city outside new york where hamilton will be seen \( starting on sept 27 \) broadway in chicago has sold out its fall subscription package for the first time , according to lou raizin , the organization s president the company has not yet started selling tickets to nonsubscribers and there will be many such tickets available , because the show plans to stay in chicago as long as sales are healthy but , mr raizin said we believe there will be very strong demand you d have to be hiding under a rock not to have that opinion in san francisco , where hamilton is expected to run at the shn orpheum theater for 21 weeks , starting next march , shn , which operates two locations in the city , expects to have 40 , 000 members enroll for its season , up from the usual 20 , 000 to 23 , 000 hamilton has been an incredible driver for membership sales , said greg

"title ads focus on relief from the presidential campaign the new york times author sapna maheshwari text hefty is trashing the campaign , excedrin is curing headaches caused by the caustic debates , and ringling brothers wants to remind the public that it is the real circus , despite what the last few months may have seemed like in previous election years , it was not unusual for brands to create ads that lightly poked fun at the political process or went heavy on patriotism and optimism now , marketers have a new focus when connecting with voters fatigue and disillusionment whether you re completely conservative or more liberal , it s kind of like everybody s sick of this conversation and the low trashy depths that this election has gone to , said jason peterson , chief creative officer of havas north america , which oversees hefty s advertising people visiting the cnn and fox news websites in the last few days may have noticed stark black banner ads with white letters declaring , this political ad has been trashed thanks to hefty hefty , the trash bag maker , seized on the five days leading up to election day to run such ads across several major political news sites and videos on youtube its hope is to curry favor with americans by shielding them from additional political messaging after a long , vitriolic presidential race people are almost demanding this kind of relief , mr peterson said it is perhaps harder now to make light of the election as businesses have during previous campaigns , as when jetblue offered international trips to voters whose candidate lost , pizza hut stitched together debate clips to highlight how cheap its pizza was or snickers ran cheeky don t vote hungry ads tecate , the mexican beer label , was seen as poking fun at donald j trump with its recent commercial featuring a tecate beer wall , a ledge to rest beers on , even though the brand said the ad was nonpartisan indeed , the appetite for humor seems low in an environment where both skittles and tic tac had to issue formal statements within weeks of each another distancing themselves from untoward mentions by the trump campaign so come the new tactics hefty said its digital campaign , which started on thursday and will run through tuesday , was built on the belief that americans hate political ads just last month , the american psychological association said that 52 percent of american adults cited the presidential election as a very or somewhat significant source of stress in a survey conducted by harris poll and the final new york news poll released late last week showed that more than eight in 10 voters said the campaign had left them repulsed rather than excited excedrin , on the day of the third and final presidential debate last month , promoted the hashtag debateheadache on twitter , saying , debates bring headaches excedrin brings fast headache relief the brand tweeted out statistics from a survey it conducted throughout the day , including one that said 73 percent of americans would experience headaches this year the product , given its focus on relieving head pain , doesn t generally have the opportunity to speak on a larger scale , especially during a presidential election , said scott yacovino , a senior brand manager for excedrin and the united states pain business at glaxosmithkline this situation was a perfect storm , he said even during the first debate , there was a lot of organic chatter around people getting headaches and the election causing headaches , mr yacovino said we thought we could bring our benefit to folks no matter what their political affiliations are another ad campaign born out of election fatigue came from ringling brothers and barnum bailey last month , which officially denounced the use of the term circus to refer to this year s presidential race its social media tracking tool showed that between oct 15 and oct 24 , the terms circus or clowns were used to describe the election or candidates an average of almost 4 , 000 times a day as part of its effort to take back the circus , the company made a humorous video featuring several performers expressing their indignation over misuse of the terms in one scene , a ringmaster turned to the camera and said , people keep calling candidates clowns a clown by his side responded , but we re real clowns , and we take clowning seriously hefty s banner ads have appeared on cnn , fox news , aol , and the huffington post s politics page hefty s youtube ads will be aimed at people tracking the election , especially in swing states like north carolina and pennsylvania the company s agency said its purchase guaranteed at least 40 million page views across the sites we did pick out media buys based upon where more of the trashy politics are going on and more in the swing states where it s getting heated , mr peterson said he added what i really love about it and what i think consumers appreciate in advertising is when you re able to offer them a utility to what they re feeling and to me , people are sick and tired",1.0
"title facebook said to create censorship tool to get back into china the new york times author mike isaac text san francisco mark zuckerberg , facebook s chief executive , has cultivated relationships with china s leaders , including president xi jinping he has paid multiple visits to the country to meet its top internet executives he has made an effort to learn mandarin inside facebook , the work to enter china runs far deeper the social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people s news feeds in specific geographic areas , according to three current and former facebook employees , who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential the feature was created to help facebook get into china , a market where the social network has been blocked , these people said mr zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort , the people added facebook has restricted content in other countries before , such as pakistan , russia and turkey , in keeping with the typical practice of american internet companies that generally comply with government requests to block certain content after it is posted facebook blocked roughly 55 , 000 pieces of content in about 20 countries between july 2015 and december 2015 , for example but the new feature takes that a step further by preventing content from appearing in feeds in china in the first place facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself instead , it would offer the software to enable a third party in this case , most likely a partner chinese company to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network , the people said facebook s partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users feeds the current and former facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering china and , like many experiments inside facebook , it may never see the light of day the feature , whose code is visible to engineers inside the company , has so far gone unused , and there is no indication that facebook has offered it to the authorities in china but the project illustrates the extent to which facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements , to make the world more open and connected , to gain access to a market of 1 4 billion chinese people even as facebook faces pressure to continue growing mr zuckerberg has often asked where the company s next billion users will come from china has been cordoned off to the social network since 2009 because of the government s strict rules around censorship of user content the suppression software has been contentious within facebook , which is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users after the american presidential election s unexpected outcome spurred questions over fake news on the social network several employees who were working on the project have left facebook after expressing misgivings about it , according to the current and former employees a facebook spokeswoman said in a statement , we have long said that we are interested in china , and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country she added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into china facebook s tricky position underscores the difficulties that many american internet companies have had gaining access to china for years , companies like google and twitter have been blocked there for refusing to yield to the government s demands around censorship in 2010 , google said it was directing users of its search engine in china to its service in hong kong , because of censorship and intrusion from hackers other companies , like the professional social networking service linkedin , agreed to censor some content on their platforms in china the current climate for internet companies in china may not help facebook in august , the giant uber gave up an expensive battle to crack the chinese market , selling its chinese business to an incumbent rival , didi chuxing more broadly , china has streamlined and tightened its controls over the internet under president xi , targeting influential social media celebrities and adding new reviews to popular online video sites still , some officials responsible for china s tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of facebook s operating in the country it would legitimize china s strict style of internet governance , and if done according to official standards , would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic even so , resistance remains at the top levels of chinese leadership some analysts have said facebook s best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor finding a partner and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in facebook s china operation would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the silicon valley company it would also let facebook rely on a local company s government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with beijing facebook and chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social network s entering the market , according to employees who were involved in the discussions , though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise facebook currently sells advertising for some chinese businesses from its hong kong office among its customers are sites that act as the propaganda arm of the chinese government , and that operate official accounts where they post articles chinese citizens who wish to gain access to facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network , or vpn it s unclear when the suppression tool originated , but the project picked up momentum in the last year , as engineers were plucked from other parts of facebook to work on the effort , the current and former employees said the project was led by vaughan smith , a vice president for mobile , corporate and business development at facebook , they said like mr zuckerberg , mr smith speaks a smattering of mandarin unveiling a new censorship tool in china could lead to more demands to suppress content from other countries the problem , which has hit countries across the globe , has already led some governments to use the issue as an excuse to target sites of political rivals , or shut down social media sites altogether over the summer , several facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company , the current and former employees said internally , so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that , in july , it became a topic at one of facebook s weekly friday afternoon sessions mr zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool he told the gathering that facebook s china plans were nascent but he also struck a pragmatic tone about the future , according to employees who attended the session it s better for facebook to be a part of enabling conversation , even if it s not yet the full conversation , mr zuckerberg said , according to employees",1.0

"title trump fires adviser s son from transition for spreading fake news the new york times author matthew rosenberg , maggie haberman and eric schmitt text washington donald j trump on tuesday fired one of his transition team s staff members , michael g flynn , the son of mr trump s choice for national security adviser , for using twitter to spread a fake news story about hillary clinton that led to an armed confrontation in a pizza restaurant in washington the uproar over mr flynn s twitter post cast a harsh spotlight on the views that he and his father , lt gen michael t flynn , aired on social media throughout the presidential campaign both men have shared fake news stories alleging that mrs clinton committed felonies , and have posted their own twitter messages that at times have crossed into islamophobia but their social media musings apparently attracted little attention from mr trump or his transition team before a north carolina man fired a rifle on sunday inside comet ping pong , which was the subject of false stories tying it and the clinton campaign to a child sex trafficking ring hours after the episode , the younger mr flynn , 33 , went on twitter to say that until pizzagate was proved false , it remained a story on tuesday morning , after the post had attracted national attention and it was reported that mr flynn had a transition team email address , vice mike pence denied that mr flynn had ever worked for the team , saying on msnbc s morning joe that he had no involvement in the transition whatsoever but later in the morning , jason miller , a transition spokesman , tacitly acknowledged that mr flynn had worked for the transition , saying in a conference call that mr flynn was now no longer involved mr miller did not say what prompted the dismissal of mr flynn , but two other trump transition officials said it was tied to his twitter posting the move may have cost the younger mr flynn an eventual post in the white house until tuesday , he had planned to join his father on the staff of the national security council and had even started the process of getting a security clearance , according to an acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting the flynns despite the younger mr flynn s abrupt removal from the transition team , there was no indication that mr trump was reconsidering his choice of general flynn , 57 , a former director of the defense intelligence agency , to serve as national security adviser but beyond the tight circle around mr trump , there were growing concerns in washington about general flynn s fitness for the job , fueled by talk of his temperament , his conspiratorial worldview and his own incendiary twitter postings many democrats were openly critical from the moment the appointment was announced last month , and several prominent republican national security officials also quietly voiced concerns now , with mr flynn under growing scrutiny , some are beginning to speak publicly the national security adviser should have a moderating effect on the instincts of the president , and it remains to be seen if mike can do that , michael v hayden , a former director of both the c i a and the national security agency , said in a telephone interview on tuesday the role of national security adviser calls for mediating the conflicting views of cabinet secretaries and agencies , and sifting fact from speculation and rumor to help the new president decide how the united states should react to international crises it is a job that is likely to take on greater importance for mr trump , who has no experience in defense or foreign policy issues and has a habit of making broad assertions that are not based in fact general flynn , too , has shown similar inclinations both on twitter and in his previous jobs in the military at the defense intelligence agency , his staff members even coined their own name for his sometimes dubious assertions flynn facts he has regularly engaged in the reckless public promotion of conspiracy theories that have no basis in fact , with disregard for the risks that giving credence to those theories could pose to the public , representative adam smith of washington , the ranking democrat on the house armed services committee , said on tuesday someone who is so oblivious to the facts , or intentionally ignorant of them , should not be entrusted with policy decisions that affect the safety of the american people , mr smith added for now , general flynn appears to be weathering the criticism , which has been far harsher than that directed at other trump nominees , by keeping a relatively low profile since the election he has not given interviews he did not respond to requests for comment and he has kept his twitter posts relatively tame , publishing patriotic messages on veterans day and more recently praising mr trump s selection of gen james n mattis , a retired marine , for defense secretary his son , in contrast , showed no such restraint in the weeks before he was fired , regularly posting on twitter about conspiracy theories involving mrs clinton and her campaign staff well after the election he continued to push his support for the fake news about comet ping pong after his messages on twitter about sunday s episode began attracting widespread attention it was not until shortly before 3 30 p m monday that he went silent on twitter in one of the last messages he posted , he shared a post from another twitter user who sought to spread a conspiracy theory that sprang up on the fringes after the shooting that the suspect arrested at comet ping pong , edgar m welch , 28 , of salisbury , n c was actually an actor , and that the episode was a hoax cooked up to discredit the claim of a sex trafficking ring at the restaurant",1.0
"title the tyranny of other people s vacation photos the new york times author henry alford text chief among my favorite facebook memories is the time that a journalist of my acquaintance breezily informed us all that he was at the grill room of the four seasons with ted danson , tucking into some sea urchin to which one friend responded , that s funny , because i m at the midtown tunnel with rhea perlman , eating shawarma while some frequent users of social media are merely fabulous , others savvily buff their fabulousness to a dazzling gleam , becoming fahvolous at no point in the year is this more evident than in august and early september , when facebook and instagram swell with the plump , juicy , harvest of summer vacation photos what prompts the excessive posting of these pictures \? william haynes , a comedian who hosts the sourcefed show people be like , said i like how my generation is all about sharing what s the point of having a vacation unless you can tell people about it immediately \? if you can get a few instagram photos out of it , you ve made your money back indeed , the motivation behind many fahvolous vacation photos would seem to be a rationalization of large expenditures for the purpose of recreation a 6 , 000 beach rental ought to bring you 6 , 000 worth of pleasure , and maybe posting a photo will get the dopamine flowing but one can detect other motives , too a attempt at a neurotic attempt to thank your host , a need for constant scrutiny noxious selfie sticks now seem like nothing compared to the sophisticated camera filters that can turn an strawberry patch into a brooding welter of chiaroscuro some people even hire professional photographers to take their vacation snaps for them in the future , it may be unsurprising at a lakeside picnic to hear a nephew turn to his aunt marjorie and ask what s your day rate \? equally jarring , some instagram and facebook users seem to want us to know that their summer is more inherently summery than ours more barefoot , more glistening , more these folks are biting into the fresh fig of life , and this biting produces carefree laughter my natural habitat is an oceanside bonfire where a viggo mortensen strums a weathered guitar ! all backyards are enlivened by a spray of girls in sundresses ! everything i eat in august is cooked on a stick ! while it s fairly easy to categorize the photographically incontinent under the headlines narcissistic and insecure , or some combination thereof , the folks may not have the same clarity about themselves people often don t know that they re the culprit , said marla vannucci , a clinical psychologist who is an associate professor at adler university i have a client who really wants likes , so he posts a lot of photos , dr vannucci said when people don t respond to them , he feels very alone so he posts more it s a cycle like any interpersonal cycle in which we re doing something that people hate but we re doing it to try to make people like us with that type of client , i try to find out what the motivation for posting is what are the feelings around it \? what is he looking for \? then i try to help him find other outlets for those on the receiving end of such founts of images , the critical factors are frequency and tone on the frequency front , young mr haynes had a good suggestion i think you get three photos per location if you can t remember whether you already posted a picture of that covered bridge , you are in danger of overestimating other people s interest in covered bridges the question of tone is more nuanced in 2014 , the software company cyberlink sponsored a poll of 2 , 268 adults in the united states , with the hypothesis , the company s senior vice president for global marketing , richard carriere , told me , that some people have a tendency to post photos on social media just to gloat and annoy their friends and colleagues the study found that one in seven who own a smartphone and who use social media would unfollow or block someone who posts what they perceive as boastful vacation pictures moreover , one in four will attempt to share a photo within one hour of arriving at their destination which makes many of us want to summon from deep within us the drama teacher who gets two syllables out of breeeeathe the top reasons that those sampled said they would like or favorite a picture were if it showed friends and family sharing a special moment \( 63 percent \) they look happy \( 58 percent \) or they look genuine and natural \( 48 percent \) i expressed surprise to mr carriere that the poll didn t break down the specifics of bothersome photos i said , i m going to guess that the most troublesome one would be a vacation photo in which your ex is dating someone who s essentially you , but 15 years younger , and it s a picture of the two of them in the tiny fishing village in portugal that you turned your ex on to in the first place mr carriere said , i would definitely unfriend my ex for that in some instances , people exposed to what they perceive to be a surfeit of photos will express their ire offline in 2014 , the milwaukee journal sentinel published an article about a couple who received an anonymous letter in the mail about their facebook posts the letter read , in part , it s a little upsetting seeing , hearing and reading about someone s vacations all year while we all can t afford one the letter concluded with go have some kids and don t be so selfish as to only think of yourselves all the time yet one of the trips the couple had taken was a trip to new york that they had bought at a breast cancer benefit , not to mention the fact that the wife of the couple works as a psychotherapist who specializes in helping sexually and physically abused children equally odd were the facts that the letter s envelope was emblazoned with a bright yellow smiley sticker and that the postmark was miami , a city that none of the couple s friends live in so maybe the letter writer was on vacation at the time the wife of the couple put the letter on facebook with the instruction please feel free to unfriend us from facebook as we clearly are not friends if you re unsure how to unfriend someone , go to the help menu the couples friends rallied with support in the post s comments section maybe if they spent less time on fb stalking you , one wrote , they could work more , make more money and go on a vacation , too in certain rare instances , too many vacation photos are not enough dr vannucci said that after one of his clients had his wedding canceled at the last minute , he was really struggling he posted that it was called off but that he was still going to enjoy the honeymoon on came a cavalcade of photos of one man s painful efforts at readjustment , all of them captioned , dr vannucci said , with funny , raw but heartbreaking comments one groom s stations of the cross conscious that my own trickle of emotionally stifled summertime photos on facebook is its own version of fahvolousness , i spent a recent trip to spain myself while , yes , i did share a picture of an outpost of the restaurant chain museo del jamon , i did not post a slew of others not the stylish dog walker and her dachshund that i intended to caption tiny pants , tiny dog madrid not the gorgeous ceilings of the alhambra not the trip home when my boyfriend clutched his neck pillow to his chest and referred to it as comfort bosoms but am i being immodest when i tell you that i now see these omissions as a disservice to my friends and colleagues , who may have loved them i am trying to calibrate my photographic output as we all should in the meantime , let us all delicately start a conversation about one of this topic s thorniest issues indeed , let us try to find some common ground with respect to photography s one essential verity i ll start us out here all sunsets are kitsch",1.0

he is the former director of russia s antidoping lab who oversaw drug testing at the 2014 sochi olympics he resigned last november after another investigation accused russia of doping that was coordinated by government officials and dr rodchenkov dr rodchenkov did not fully cooperate with that inquiry , and after its results were published , he fled to the united states , fearing for his life in russia , he said when did he speak out , and what did he say \? in los angeles in may , he told the new york times that russia had seen hosting the olympics as an opportunity to control the antidoping lab results and allow athletes to use drugs throughout the competition he said that at sochi , he had carried out orders from the country s sports ministry to win at any cost , protecting top russian olympians who were on steroids from getting caught at least 15 russian medalists at sochi used banned substances , dr rodchenkov s records indicated how did the scheme that he detailed work \? dr rodchenkov said he had received spreadsheets from the russian sports ministry that named top athletes who were part of the doping program in the months leading up to the olympics , he said , those athletes collected their clean urine and provided it in containers soda bottles and baby formula bottles , for example that were stockpiled in a freezer at sochi , dr rodchenkov said , he spent most nights , from around midnight on , replacing urine samples tainted by drugs with clean urine from the same athletes , somehow breaking into the supposedly bottles that are the standard at international competitions he did so with the help of members of russia s intelligence service , he said for hours each night , the small team worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp , passing bottles of urine through a hole in the wall , to be ready for testing the next day , rodchenkov said how could the bottles have been breached \?

how did he know whose urine was whose \? each urine sample is coded with a unique number dr rodchenkov said that athletes had taken pictures of their sample forms , including the code , and texted them to the ministry , offering forbidden insight into the samples is there any other way to prove what he said \? dr rodchenkov said that he had added table salt to some of the urine samples he tampered with to make the specific gravity a chemistry measurement recorded on the samples match the specifications of the original tainted samples he has encouraged investigators to examine russian athletes urine from sochi which is still being stored in a laboratory in lausanne , switzerland to test for excessive levels of table salt , and to examine the glass bottles for telltale scratches around their necks , where the interlocking metal rings sit who conducted the investigation \? richard mclaren , a canadian lawyer , led the inquiry , which was commissioned in may by the world agency mr mclaren was also part of a independent investigation that , last year , accused russia of widespread , doping what will happen next \? any decision to discipline russia would rest with international sports federations and the international olympic committee last month , the global track and field authorities barred russian athletes from the rio games wada has indicated that it could recommend barring the entire russian delegation over the weekend , several national antidoping organizations and athlete groups made it clear that they were preparing to ask the i o c to bar the entire russian federation from the games the organizations discussing taking that extraordinary step included the antidoping agencies of the united states , canada , new zealand , japan , spain and switzerland how will russia react \? vitaly mutko , russia s minister of sport , dismissed the significance of the mclaren investigation , which did not consult with him during its inquiry and which , along with wada , does not have the power to do anything beyond issue recommendations to the i o c and sports federations russia is challenging the ban imposed on its track and field team , and further legal action may follow if additional disciplinary measures are imposed the court of arbitration for sport in switzerland is set to have a hearing this week regarding the ban on russia s track team , and a decision on that could come as soon as wednesday",1.0

"title avoiding the dreaded middle seat may now cost you the new york times author martha c white text as flying goes , the only thing more uncomfortable than sitting next to a couple having a spat on an airplane , maury rogoff learned , is sitting between that couple especially when one partner prefers bare feet ms rogoff , who owns a public relations firm with offices in new york and florida and travels frequently , discovered what a growing number of travelers now know the middle seat has become the third rail of flying and it is getting harder to avoid as planes fly at record capacity and new cabin configurations squeeze in ever more passengers , airlines are , intentionally or not , nudging fliers into paying extra to avoid drawing the proverbial short straw i was literally in the middle of their argument , ms rogoff said it was just that awful her discomfort was magnified when the husband kicked off his shoes and crossed his legs , thrusting a bare foot into ms rogoff s space her entreaties with his wife to swap seats fell on deaf ears of course she had no interest because it was middle , and because it was a smelly foot , ms rogoff said for travelers like ms rogoff , airlines are making it harder than ever to avoid the middle seat based on luck alone southwest , which does not assign seats , raised the price of an pass to 15 from 12 50 last month for those who do not pay up , it is a mad rush when online opens 24 hours before the flight delta air lines basic economy fare , introduced last year , does not allow seat assignments to be made until after when customers have had a chance to claim window and aisle seats american airlines and united airlines plan to introduce similar fares this year neither would confirm whether selecting a seat would be one of the perks eliminated , but one airline analyst said it was likely , given the competition legacy airlines face from carriers it s a way to compete , said max rayner , a partner at hudson crossing , a consulting firm in new york if you want to go at premium times , there will be far fewer seats available at the lower end of prices mr rayner suggested that this shift in pricing models wasn t necessarily a bad thing , saying it could be a boon for the most customers you can think of it actually as opening up choice , he said you just want basic transportation sure , here it is but the crunch has left some travelers taking extreme measures to avoid getting stuck in the middle fliers said they have offered fellow travelers money or drinks to switch seats , paid the fee to upgrade to a premium or exit row , feigned illness or switched flights some travelers even report buying two seats , just to have an empty one next to them dr sachin shridharani , a plastic surgeon in new york , found himself on an overbooked flight back from san diego , and a middle seat was the only one available i told them i d be willing to take another flight , he said i ll pretty much do just about anything to avoid sitting in that notorious , infamous middle seat the was to wait in the airport for four hours , but dr shridharani said it was worth it so he could work on the way home you can t have someone looking over your shoulder , he said in the end , analysts say , airlines are selling a form of real estate , but they are trading in square inches , not square feet people buy work space that s really what they buy on board , said robert w mann jr an airline industry consultant some of those configurations may not give you enough room , for example , to take out a laptop and use it productively one carrier , though , has tried to address the issue frontier airlines recently installed new seats on its airbus a319 and a320 planes , with the middle seats about an inch wider than the window and aisle seats but for most passengers , the tight squeeze continues , and business travelers say counting on their status to avoid the middle seat is no longer a sure thing you can t show up at the airport hoping to talk your way into an upgrade , said mark jeffries , a corporate speaker and author you don t see free seats anymore mr jeffries said he sometimes buys two seats a window or aisle , and a middle it s cheaper than buying a or ticket on a legacy carrier , he said we find that people will pay for premium economy or any kind of seat assignment if they re traveling solo to avoid the middle seat , said julia douglas , owner and president of jet set world travel in chicago some travelers will spend hundreds of dollars more , she added another approach is to appeal to another traveler there have been instances where i ve bought someone an upgrade , said michael winston , who used to travel once or twice a week while working in management consulting at times , he said , he had resorted to bargaining with seatmates to avoid the middle seat it is not an uncommon transaction , frequent travelers say , with cash , upgrades and cocktails all serving as forms of currency but that is assuming that the seats are available last year , airline capacity again hit a record high , just shy of 85 percent , meaning that a lot of flights are full and that leaves flight attendants and travel agents acting as de facto referees for games of midair musical chairs the excuses passengers use to avoid the middle seat are many , they say long legs is always one , ms douglas said she then listed the most common complaints claustrophobia , a need for frequent trips to the bathroom , panic attacks and a penchant for airsickness i don t know if any of them are truly medically founded , she said i just think it s anxiety about being in that middle seat of all the excuses , genuine or exaggerated , the one that seems most effective is the threat of gastrointestinal distress william bauer , who travels frequently as an executive at a manufacturer of leather goods , said that hinting at a medical need for quick access to the bathroom usually prompted either gate agents or fellow passengers to make the switch for him make it clear that you need that aisle seat really convey a compelling sense of urgency , he said thus far , i ve never been rejected on one recent flight , though , the tables were turned when mr bauer found himself on the receiving end of a plea to swap seats on a flight there was a woman i gave up my aisle seat for because she cried , he said if you cry , you win",1.0

"title wells fargo offers regrets , but doesn t admit misconduct the new york times author michael corkery text wells fargo was flowing with regrets on friday , taking out ads in nearly a dozen newspapers saying the bank took full responsibility for creating sham bank accounts without its customers permission the bank s chief executive officer , john stumpf , even called one prominent democrat in congress to express his willingness to assume personal responsibility for the mess the bank fired at least 5 , 300 employees and refunded millions of dollars to customers but with its banking regulators , wells fargo was not as contrite the bank agreed to pay 185 million in fines and hire an independent consultant to review its sales practices , but it was able to settle the investigation into the questionable accounts without officially admitting to any of the suspected misconduct it was classic wall street since the financial crisis , regulators have brought dozens of cases against banks and other financial firms , hitting them with tens of billions of dollars in fines and requiring the companies to overhaul their business practices but frequently , regulatory cases are settled without a bank having to admit doing anything wrong some congressional officials and governmental watchdog groups say regulators may be too eager to extract a fine and to settle a case quickly than to prove a bank s guilt in court it could take years of court battles for regulators to prove that every one of the 1 5 million accounts that wells said may have been unauthorized was indeed phony it s very troubling , senator jeff merkley , an oregon democrat and member of the banking committee , said in a telephone interview friday wells fargo is saying they take responsibility , but they aren t actually taking responsibility in the official sense mr merkley said he wants the leadership of the banking committee to hold hearings on the wells fargo scandal he hopes to hear testimony not only from bank executives , but from regulators on why they agreed to the settlement terms without an admission of wrongdoing from the bank republican staff members of the banking committee were briefed by wells fargo executives on friday the staff is still collecting information from the bank to help committee members decide whether the scandal warrants hearings , people briefed on the matter said a wells fargo spokeswoman said that while the bank readily admits that it created questionable accounts , it does not agree with other findings by its banking regulators , namely that the bank s culture and business model fostered such behavior we recognize that these instances occurred , and we want to be very open about that and make sure they don t happen again , said mary eshet , the wells fargo spokeswoman but this was not part of an intentional strategy legal experts say that not admitting wrongdoing may have another benefit for wells fargo helping the bank defend itself against lawsuits from aggrieved customers it ends up being a said robert hockett , a professor at cornell law school the regulator gets some kind of payment from the accused , and the accused gets to ease the risk of private plaintiff litigation by not admitting to guilt wells has already been hit with a number of lawsuits over the phony accounts in addition to the 1 5 million sham bank accounts that regulators say may have been opened , there were an additional 565 , 000 credit card accounts that bank employees may have applied for without customer consent in some cases , bank employees would move money from a customer s existing deposit account to open up another one the unauthorized account was then quickly closed , but the bank employee got credit for drumming up new business regulators said employees were given financial incentives to open up as many new accounts as they could , as part of a bank culture to grow business much of the illegal activity took place in california , including in and around los angeles , where the city attorney filed a lawsuit against the bank last year over the questionable accounts the consumer financial protection bureau and the office of the comptroller of the currency then joined the investigation , which broadened to encompass several other states as part of the settlement , wells agreed to pay 100 million to the consumer protection bureau , the largest fine ever levied by that agency still , the fine pales next to the penalties that banks like jpmorgan chase and bank of america paid to settle civil investigations into soured mortgage securities sold in the to the financial crisis wells is paying what amounts to a couple of parking tickets for each of the 1 5 million accounts , mr hockett said regulators say that the wells fargo fine may look small by comparison , but that the amount of financial harm to the consumer is relatively small wells said that the average refund to consumers was 25 some regulators have vowed to push more financial firms to officially own up to their misdeeds in a speech in 2013 , mary jo white , the chairwoman of the securities and exchange commission , noted that in criminal court , judges will not accept a guilty plea unless the accused admits to the unlawful conduct ms white said in the financial industry , pushing companies to officially admit to their actions was important to public accountability anyone who has witnessed a guilty plea understands the power of such admissions , ms white said in her speech it creates an unambiguous record of the conduct and demonstrates unequivocally the defendant s responsibility for his or her acts that said , there will still be times that the securities agency would settle cases without such admissions just this week , the s e c settled a case with the investment firm raymond james over trading commissions the firm settled the case without admitting or denying the findings by

"title cities vow to fight trump on immigration , even if they lose millions the new york times author jennifer medina and jess bidgood text los angeles here in los angeles , where nearly half of the city s residents are latino , mayor eric garcetti has vowed to do everything he can to fight widespread deportations of illegal immigrants in new york , with a large and diverse latino population , mayor bill de blasio has pledged not to cooperate with immigration agents and mayor rahm emanuel of chicago has declared that it will always be a sanctuary city across the nation , officials in sanctuary cities are gearing up to oppose donald j trump if he follows through on a campaign promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants they are promising to maintain their policies of limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents in doing so , municipal officials risk losing millions of dollars in federal assistance for their cities that helps pay for services like fighting crime and running homeless shelters mr trump has vowed to block all federal funding for cities where local law enforcement agencies do not cooperate with immigration and customs enforcement agents but as mr trump prepares to take office , democratic bastions , including boston , philadelphia and san francisco , have reaffirmed plans to defy the administration and act as a kind of bulwark against mass deportations i like to compare this to conscientious objector status , said mayor libby schaaf of oakland , calif we are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws supporters of tougher immigration policies , however , expect a swift response dan stein , the president of the federation for american immigration reform , which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants , predicted a very aggressive , support for using the full power of the federal government to discourage this kind of interference these local politicians take it upon themselves to allow people who have been here for a long time to stay here and receive services , mr stein said the trump administration is basically saying , if you want to accommodate , don t expect the rest of us to pay for your services some believe mr trump could go further than simply pulling federal funding , perhaps fighting such policies in court or even prosecuting city leaders this is uncharted territory in some ways , to see if they re just playing chicken , or see if they will relent , said jessica vaughan , the director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies , which supports reduced immigration cities have gotten away with this for a long time because the federal government has never attempted to crack down on them , ms vaughan said the fight could also signal a twist in the struggle over the power of the federal government , as this time liberal cities rather than conservative states resist what they see as federal intervention cities may not have the power to give people rights , said muzaffar chishti , the director of the migration policy institute s office at the new york university school of law but they have a lot of power of resistance , and that s what they re displaying right now no legal definition of sanctuary cities exists , and many mayors dislike the label , saying it unfairly describes policies that merely stop local law enforcement from acting as immigration deputies generally , the term refers to jurisdictions that have placed limits on when local law enforcement agencies comply with federal requests to hold undocumented immigrants for detention and turn them over to immigration and customs enforcement those requests greatly increased after the obama administration extended nationwide an electronic monitoring system by which the fingerprints of every person booked by local or state police are sent to the department of homeland security for checking against immigration databases more than 500 counties and cities have some kind of policy limiting cooperation with the immigration authorities , according to an estimate from the immigrant legal resource center , an advocacy and legal assistance group in san francisco and washington the latest fight is beginning to play out much like one that occurred in the when activists in the nation s big cities resisted the immigration policies of the reagan administration central americans had become the subject of fierce political jockeying , and scores of churches opened their doors as sanctuaries to flout the reagan white house members of churches and synagogues are again offering their houses of worship as sanctuaries for undocumented people fearing deportation , according to groups that work with immigrants and refugees a network known as the sanctuary movement was revived in the past few years to take in those at risk of deportation by the obama administration in oakland , a site of resistance a generation ago , ms schaaf has no doubt that the community will again marshal its resources to help undocumented immigrants the city is exploring ways to offer legal services to immigrants we do have many undocumented immigrants , but often these are residents who came to our city as toddlers they have grown up here and gone to our public schools , ms schaaf said these are not illegal aliens , they are friends children , people sitting next to us in our church pews and on the bus here it feels much more personal oakland stands to lose as much as 140 million in federal funding for homeless shelters , meals for the elderly and preschool programs ms schaaf has started asking local philanthropists if they will put up money to replace any lost federal funds this is our highest priority as far as our response to this election , she said in the past , conservatives have embraced the notion that state and city officials can assert themselves with immigration laws one of mr trump s immigration advisers is kris w kobach , who helped write a law in arizona that allowed the police to question people they detained about immigration status that provision was upheld by the supreme court rudolph w giuliani , an adviser to mr trump who is expected to join his administration , unsuccessfully sued the government in 1996 , when he was the mayor of new york , over a federal law he said infringed on local protections for undocumented immigrants the latest clash will be most acutely felt in california , home to an estimated 2 3 million of the country s 11 million undocumented immigrants not only does the state allow such immigrants to obtain driver s licenses , but it also offers them college tuition and allows them to hold professional licenses to work as lawyers , architects and nurses a state law passed in 2014 limits counties cooperation with federal officials the policies came under renewed attack last year , after a young woman was shot by an immigrant with a criminal record who lived in the state illegally and had been released by the authorities in san francisco los angeles , which in 1979 became the first city to specifically bar officers from stopping people to ask about their immigration status , could lose as much as 500 million of its 9 billion budget the amount includes money for antiterrorism programs and community health centers taking away funding because our law enforcement will not act as federal agents would not only be irresponsible but immoral , mr garcetti said it would be an unprecedented overreach of federal executive power to take even more of our taxes away mr de blasio in new york has signaled that he will look for more ways to fight widespread deportations , and the city is directing undocumented immigrants to its free legal services new york has the country s largest municipal identification program and maintains a database of nearly a million people mr de blasio has pledged not to give any information from the program to the federal government melissa keaney , a lawyer at the national immigration law center , said the federal government could not compel states to carry out immigration enforcements anything that tries to coerce a local government is going to be challenged because these agencies are only responsible for local arrests , ms keaney said their responsibility is for carrying out public safety criminal law , and it is not within their responsibility or authority to act as federal agents how much cities can fight off deportations , however , remains unclear legal experts say that city officials cannot bar immigration agents and that it is unlikely that they could declare a physical sanctuary on public property much of their resistance may lie in simply not cooperating rick su , a law professor at the university at buffalo who has researched immigration and local government , said that unless mr trump ratchets up the number and reach of federal immigration agents , it is difficult to see how he can achieve the two to three million removals that he has proposed without state and local assistance in identifying and detaining suspected unauthorized immigrants for now , many city leaders are focusing on calming undocumented immigrants frayed nerves jorge elorza , the mayor of providence , r i and the son of undocumented guatemalan immigrants who were eventually naturalized , stood behind

"title achieving mindfulness at work , no meditation cushion required the new york times author matthew e may text in a recent seminar i gave for over 100 business professionals , i asked the participants to play a simple word association game with me i say mindfulness , you say the word that rang out in unison was , of course , meditation mindfulness , it seems , has become a mainstream business practice and a kind of industry in its own right meditation instructors are the new management gurus , and companies including google , general electric , ford motor and american express are sending their employees to classes that can run up to 50 , 000 for a large audience many mindfulness apps exist , nearly all of which focus on mindfulness meditation the proliferation of meditation in the name of mindfulness and the combination of the two terms naturally lead people to equate the two mistakenly so by most definitions , mindfulness is a attention that involves noticing changes around us and fully experiencing them in real time this puts us in the present , aware and responsive , making everything fresh and new again meditation is simply one of several tools for achieving mindfulness , and in the context of work it may not be the most suitable for many people for those who , like me , can t seem to get the hang of meditation , there is good news you don t have to meditate to become more mindful there are two approaches to mindfulness eastern and western the eastern view indeed positions meditation as an essential tool to achieving a mindful state but the eastern view is more about quieting the mind and suspending thought this philosophy is almost the complete opposite of the western view of mindfulness , which centers on active thinking i would argue that given the speed of change today , it may not be realistic to suspend or stop thinking rather , we need to actively think through problems in new ways to achieve innovative , elegant solutions these will not rain from on high in a meditation session both views share the same goal avoiding mindlessness when we re mindless , the past is riding herd over the present we get trapped in categories created in the past , stuck in rigid perspectives , oblivious to alternative views this gives us the illusion of certainty for example , imagine that the numbers in the incorrect roman numeral equation below are movable sticks leaving the plus and equals signs as they are , what is the least number of sticks you would have to move to correct the equation \? xi i x most people react immediately with an answer of one but that is a mindless answer , based on knowledge acquired long ago the optimal answer would be zero , arrived at by looking at the problem from an alternative perspective by looking at the problem upside down , you could read the equation literally right to left , so that x \( 10 \) i \( one \) plus ix \( nine \) or you might recognize the visual symmetry , and reflect it in a mirror by noticing different ways to view the problem , you move from mindless to mindful this kind of noticing mindfulness is similar to the concept of the impartial spectator first introduced in the 18th century by adam smith , who wrote that we all have access to an impartial and spectator this spectator s form of attention puts us in the present and gives us a more unbiased perspective much the way our attention is focused when we travel to a new place , noticing details that the locals take for granted the key to mindfulness is learning to look at the world in a more conditional way understanding that our perspective is merely one among alternative views requires us to embrace uncertainty when we re uncertain and unsure , our surroundings become interesting again , like the peculiar little details we notice when we arrive in an unfamiliar place the most effective technique i ve found for moving from mindless to mindful without meditation involves a form of and talking to yourself as an objective adviser would it is achievable in a few simple steps suppose you re facing a situation that s causing you stress perhaps a change at work , a tough problem or an important decision the first step is to realize that you ve already made two unwarranted assumptions that something will happen , and it will be bad next , give yourself three reasons the issue you re worried about might not happen notice that it immediately becomes less stressful , because you just went from it s going to happen to maybe it will happen , maybe it won t now give yourself three reasons that , if the situation does turn out bad , good things will happen those reasons are easy to find once you ask the question now you ve gone from thinking there s this terrible thing that s going to happen to thinking there s this thing that may or may not happen , but if it does , it could have both good and bad outcomes it s an easy method that leads us to become less reactive to the world still responsive , just not reactive in the end , the entire key to eliminating mindlessness without meditation may simply be realizing that the issue looks different from a different perspective , and then taking that perspective",1.0
"title tribunal rejects beijing s claims in south china sea the new york times author jane perlez text beijing an international tribunal in the hague delivered a sweeping rebuke on tuesday of china s behavior in the south china sea , including its construction of artificial islands , and found that its expansive claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis the landmark case , brought by the philippines , was seen as an important crossroads in china s rise as a global power and in its rivalry with the united states , and it could force beijing to reconsider its assertive tactics in the region or risk being labeled an international outlaw it was the first time the chinese government had been summoned before the international justice system in its most significant finding , the tribunal rejected china s argument that it enjoys historic rights over most of the south china sea that could give the governments of brunei , indonesia , malaysia , taiwan and vietnam more leverage in their own maritime disputes with beijing the tribunal also said that china had violated international law by causing irreparable harm to the marine environment , endangering philippine ships and interfering with philippine fishing and oil exploration it s an overwhelming victory we won on every significant point , said the philippines chief counsel in the case , paul s reichler but while the decision is legally binding , there is no mechanism for enforcing it , and china , which refused to participate in the tribunal s proceedings , reiterated on tuesday that it would not abide by it speaking at a meeting with european leaders , president xi jinping was defiant , reasserting china s claim to sovereignty over the south china sea since ancient times , the people s daily reported his remarks echoed a statement from the foreign ministry the tribunal s decision is invalid and has no binding force , the ministry said china does not accept or recognize it the foreign secretary of the philippines , perfecto yasay jr welcomed the ruling as significant and called on all those concerned to exercise restraint and sobriety the five judges and legal experts on the tribunal ruled unanimously , and the decision was so heavily in favor of the philippines that there were fears about how the chinese leadership would react many in the region worry that beijing will accelerate its efforts to assert control over the south china sea , which includes vital trade routes and fishing waters as well as possible oil and mineral deposits xi jinping has lost face here , and it will be difficult for china to do nothing , said bonnie s glaser , a senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies in washington i expect a very tough reaction from china , since it has lost on almost every point there is virtually nothing that it has won the philippines filed its case in 2013 , after china seized a reef over which both countries claim sovereignty there has been speculation that beijing might respond to the decision by building an artificial island at the reef , scarborough shoal , a move that could set off a conflict with the philippines and its treaty ally , the united states the state department spokesman , john kirby , said washington expected china to comply with the ruling the world is watching to see if china is really the global power it professes itself to be and the responsible power that it professes itself to be , he said the main issue before the panel was the legality of china s claim to waters within a line that appears on official chinese maps and encircles as much as 90 percent of the south china sea , an area the size of mexico the philippines had asked the tribunal to find the claim to be in violation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea , which both china and the philippines have ratified in its decision , the tribunal said any historic rights to the sea that china had previously enjoyed were extinguished by the treaty , which lays out rules for drawing zones of control over the world s oceans based on distances to coastlines the panel added that while china had used islands in the sea in the past , it had never exercised exclusive authority over the waters the panel also concluded that several disputed rocks and reefs in the south china sea were too small for china to claim control of economic activities in the waters around them as a result , it found , china was engaged in unlawful behavior in philippine waters , including activities that had aggravated the dispute the tribunal cited china s construction of a large artificial island on an atoll known as mischief reef china has built a military airstrip , naval berths and sports fields on the island , but the tribunal ruled that it was in philippine waters the judges also said that beijing had violated international law by causing severe harm to the coral reef environment and by failing to prevent chinese fishermen from harvesting endangered sea turtles and other species on a substantial scale in an early indication of the regional response , vietnam which has fraternal communist ties to china but also significant territorial disputes with it , including over oil exploration rights quickly issued a statement endorsing the tribunal s decision china has argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the case because the sovereignty of reefs and islands in the sea is disputed , beijing asserted , the tribunal could not decide on competing claims to the surrounding waters the treaty covers only maritime disputes , not land disputes in a tough speech in washington last week , a former senior chinese official , dai bingguo , said that the findings would amount to no more than waste paper and that china would not back down from its activities in the south china sea even in the face of a fleet of american aircraft carriers but with the geopolitical stakes high , mr dai also counseled moderation , saying that the situation in the south china sea must cool down the issue could have ramifications for domestic politics in china mr xi has made defense of maritime claims a central part of the governing communist party s narrative that it has restored the nation to global greatness after long periods of humiliation by bigger powers any challenge to that narrative is seen in beijing as a challenge to the party s rule on wednesday morning , an escalating propaganda campaign in china against the tribunal reached a new pitch , with all the major news outlets condemning the decision and trumpeting china s refusal to be back down we do not claim an inch of land that does not belong to us , but we won t give up any patch that is ours , said a editorial in the people s daily , which ridiculed the tribunal as a lackey of some outside forces that would be remembered as a laughingstock in human history some chinese commentators have said in recent days that the leadership may respond with immediate military maneuvers in the south china sea whether it will be significant or large scale i cannot say , said shi yinhong , a professor of international relations at renmin university in beijing china is hosting the group of 20 summit meeting in september , a major international forum that it hopes will proceed without the distraction of conflict but mr shi said he was not sure the government had that kind of patience to wait until after the gathering before taking some sort of action in a surprising opinion article on the india today website over the weekend , a professor of international relations at fudan university in shanghai , shen dingli , wrote that beijing needed to revise its stance and employ a more effective approach that maintained china s smiling image the new president of the philippines , rodrigo duterte , has signaled that he will be more accommodating toward china than was his predecessor , benigno s aquino iii the case before the tribunal was filed at the initiative of mr aquino , whose term ended june 30 soon after the case was filed , china began building artificial islands in the spratly archipelago , much of which is claimed by the philippines , in a move that many saw as a demonstration of contempt for the international court system experts in international law said that negotiations could be the most positive outcome of the case in 1986 , some noted , the united states ignored a ruling from the international court of justice that declared its mining of the harbors of nicaragua to be illegal washington had not ratified the convention on the law of the sea , and it still has not but the ruling 30 years ago by the judges in the hague emboldened congressional critics to cut funds for the reagan administration s campaign against the sandinista government in nicaragua , and it galvanized countries in central america to seek a settlement of the conflict china is not expected to vacate or dismantle the artificial islands it has built that makes the legal arguments important , analysts said the tribunal rulings will move the goal posts towards the philippines and the smaller countries , said markus gehring , a lecturer in law at cambridge university in manila , the former foreign secretary , albert f del rosario , who brought the case after years of failed negotiations with china , said the path was now open for a lasting settlement of disputes in the south china sea the award provides a basis to further talks and cooperation to encompass all parties , including china , he said",1.0

"title hands off my smiley face emoji become corporate tools the new york times author amanda hess text at last week s worldwide developers conference , apple s annual showcase of new tech , the company announced a special texting feature coming soon to iphones near you you know , sometimes you ve typed a whole message and you realize at the end that you re entirely lacking in emojification , said craig federighi , apple s senior vice president for software engineering so we provided the solution when you tap on the emoji button , we ll highlight all the emojifiable words there , and you can just tap , tap , tap , tap and emojify on a screen behind mr federighi , a simulated message underwent the process the word basketball transformed into a little black and orange cartoon image of the ball itself pizza flipped into a glistening pepperoni slice movie turned into an film camera a collective ooh wafted up from the technorati gathered in the crowd children of tomorrow will have no understanding of the english language , mr federighi said jokingly but apple s new emoji feature seems more likely to impede a different kind of skill creating surprising , figurative and subversive forms of individual expression out of the digital ephemera that populate our devices in a rush to harness the power of the web s most evocative cultural units emoji and their hyperactive cousins , gifs tech companies , corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that s sprung up around them there is a constant push and pull between people finding new ways to express themselves online , and companies trying to make money off that expression , said luke stark , who studies digital communication and psychology emoji have emerged as cultural forces in and of themselves the crisp , glyphs form a modern emotional palette and it s growing on tuesday , the unicode consortium , the body that standardizes emoji , will release 72 new ones that will soon make their way to our fingertips , including a black heart , a wilted flower and a pregnant woman emoji began as colorful icons loaded into japanese pagers in the 1990s when they first migrated to american devices several years ago , discovering emoji felt like opening a grab bag of japanese curios smiley faces , yes , but also a buffet of japanese foods \( a cut of sashimi , a fish cake , a bottle of sake \) and a host of untranslatable images but the emoji soon took on new meanings as they made their way to new countries and subcultures like the information desk person emoji \( recast as a sassy retort \) or the eggplant emoji \( which usurped the banana to become the internet s favorite phallic symbol \) in a group chat , adding emoji can feel like tacking up posters on the walls of a virtual clubhouse a lively sequence can stoke flirtatious undertones or show off sparkling wit one perfectly chosen emoji could suspend a mood in time , like an 80s movie that ends on an exultant freeze frame if emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions , gifs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility the art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media film , tv or amateur video and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat the best reaction gifs those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising but when emojis and gifs are filtered through the interests of tech companies , they often become slickly automated in addition to apple s emojification feature , there is twitter s new gif keyboard \( a partnership with the gif company giphy , which has been pumped with 78 95 million worth of funding since 2013 \) it directs twitter users to choose from a suite of emotional reactions , including agree , applause , aww and eww , which conjures a set of appropriate gifs , with those featuring the internet s most gifable

giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves a limited emotional range helps collect data on users states of mind twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet the commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding , too on snapchat , where users embellish their selfies with emoji , crayon scribbles , and elaborate lenses that cover their faces with virtual masks , marketers like mcdonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people s

beyond their japanese roots , tech companies like apple , microsoft and google \( all are voting members of unicode \) have become responsible for making cultural , and sometimes political , choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut some additions to the emoji repertoire are informed by experts unicode has consulted the cornell lab of ornithology for bird emoji advice others are culled from popular requests from online communities and proposals submitted by the public companies have also made bids to influence the result , though unicode says it rejects emojis strongly

encoding a rifle emoji alongside other glyphs , but members voted it down when vendors looked at it , they didn t see a lot of additional value in adding it , said mark davis , a unicode spokesman there s already a firearm in unicode that decision has helped stoke concerns that modern visual language is being shaped by the political or financial priorities of gigantic tech companies while many don t see the advantage of emojifying another gun , others wonder whether heightened scrutiny could lead to less idiosyncratic , less interesting characters one of the things that make emoji fun is

have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party , which was originally founded on an platform the party is polling at nearly 15 percent , ahead of some mainstream parties , for this fall s national election its rapid rise demonstrates that german nationalist politics can find a foothold in unexpected places , for example among educated young people like those at tuesday s rally those many in coat and tie , looked and primly trendy most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top , separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of hitler s mainstream parties in germany have long eschewed politics in the style of movements and have avoided shows of overt nationalism but that leaves an opening a populist party like alternative for germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters the alternative for germany supporters who were gathered in dresden , the capital of saxony , seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in germany most germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or , just as sensitive an issue , about their national identity the atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression , as if the act of cheering ideas was as important , or perhaps more so , than the ideas themselves julian m w lder , a law student , said he had initially joined the youth league of the christian democratic union , the party to which chancellor angela merkel belongs but the party did not feel like real politics , he said alternative for germany , mr w lder said , finally felt genuine this is a core part of the party s message while other parties are all the same , only alternative for germany really expresses the popular will mr w lder and other young attendees seemed tense the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies but they were jovial the rally on tuesday felt , if not like a watershed , then a glimpse of a wider , more gradual change calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own all nations have identities , after all but they remain somewhat taboo in germany and that taboo is precisely the point only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity but that risks letting those fringes define its contours mr h cke , for instance , disavowed a famous 1985 speech by richard von weizsacker , then the president of germany , that called for the allied victory to be seen as the liberation of the german people , not as their defeat mr h cke called mr weizsacker s address a speech against his own people , and not for his own people since 2015 , when germany received nearly a million asylum seekers , alternative for germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism establishment parties and other enemies , mr h cke told the crowd , are liquidating our beloved german fatherland , like a piece of soap under warm running water but we , we beloved friends , we patriots , we will close this open tap , and we will win back our germany , piece by piece yascha mounk , a lecturer at harvard and a fellow at the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund , said germany had a style of government that could leave an especially wide opening for fringe parties because the german parties tend to govern in a grand , coalition , voters often see little change when parties shift in and out politics in germany usually play out in quiet , polite negotiations among members of the coalition , rather than in dramatic , public clashes between competing parties the coalition blocks fringe parties like alternative for germany , which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate the crowd , at one point , chanted a line mr w lder has also used we are the outsiders it was a jarring moment , as many of the outsiders were young , white and wore suits and ties seemingly the definition of an insider in germany because these young germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity , they feel as if they are being oppressed , even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of europe s economies but young and old supporters of alternative for germany seemed to find something at tuesday s rally that is not common among politics a sense of impending victory not in the sense that they would oust ms merkel s government this fall she is likely to retain power but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their german pride mr mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable , given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national and for charismatic politics that left an opening for mr h cke to deliver a message beyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being german , mr mounk added , implying , though never quite stating outright , that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing mr h cke concluded his speech on tuesday with a rallying call beloved friends , we must do little less than make history , so that there will be for us germans , us europeans , a future , he said , as the audience stood , cheered and chanted his name he added , we can make history , and we are doing it",1.0

it s different from the kind of scrutiny that i ve gotten , mr schieffer said , referring to the glaring spotlight on this year s moderators it s just exponentially more mr wallace raised eyebrows after saying that he did not consider or in his words to be a central component of his moderating role his comments circulated again in the days after what was arguably mr lauer s most memorable misstep , when he failed to challenge mr trump s false claim that he had opposed the iraq war the notion of a moderator as a is too simplistic , said the rev john i jenkins , the president of the university of notre dame and a board member of the commission on presidential debates , the nonpartisan group that oversees the events what a good journalist does is ask questions that challenge the candidate to explain the moderator can t do it all the onus falls on us a little bit , as the body politic , to determine if a candidate is plausible , he added the moderator can make a mistake by being the voice of god , saying , here s the way it is he said he did not watch the nbc forum but he added that the commission had sought out moderators who would facilitate a civil and sober discussion it sounds a little moralizing , but i m a priest , so indulge me , he said in contrast with what he considered flashier , less substantive debates during the primaries is an increasingly visible tool of the modern political press , particularly in a campaign where candidates frequently bend facts and audiences often rely on partisan news outlets to interpret them there is also the presence of mr trump , a candidate who freely dissembles in a manner rarely seen in a presidential campaign still , mr schieffer , of cbs , said he believed that the chief should be the candidates if one of them says something wrong , or inconsistent with what they have said previously , the other candidate should have the first opportunity to call them on it , mr schieffer said failing that , he added , it s the moderator s responsibility to set the record straight mr lauer spoke with mrs clinton and mr trump so he could not rely on the candidate s opponent to jump in to contradict a dubious claim asked about mr lauer s performance , mr schieffer demurred , saying , i m not in the habit of piling on others were less shy in the wake of the broadcast representative charles b rangel of new york and senator harry reid of nevada , speaking at the capitol , expressed annoyance at what they saw as mr lauer s lackluster attempt to hold mr trump accountable for some of his more unusual comments he missed the whole boat , mr rangel said , referring to mr lauer jennifer palmieri , mrs clinton s communications director , contacted nbc news executives to discuss wednesday s forum , according to two people familiar with the discussion internally , the clinton campaign believed the backlash against nbc could ultimately be beneficial , if the moderators of the coming debates are on eggshells about ensuring equal treatment and holding mr trump to account mrs clinton , for her part , was already in a motorcade to her home in chappaqua , n y when mr trump appeared with mr lauer while the democratic nominee did not consider mr lauer s questions out of bounds , she did relish the subsequent coverage of the event that suggested mr trump had gotten off easy , said a person familiar with her thinking on friday , the chairman of nbc news , andrew lack , sent an upbeat memo to his staff that declared the forum a success , noting that the event had generated days of headlines about mr trump s praise of the russian president , vladimir v putin , and criticism of the american military leadership matt did a tremendous job driving one of the most serious discussions to date on these topics , wrote mr lack , who is close with mr lauer the pressure on nbc news , however , is not likely to relent the network s evening news anchor , mr holt , is set to oversee the first presidential debate , set for sept 26 at hofstra university on long island mr schieffer , who at 79 has watched more than a s worth of debates , said he had faith that this year s moderators would be prepared but , mr schieffer added there won t be a perfect debate there hasn t been one yet",1.0

"title it finally clicked that this wasn t an exercise report recounts san bernardino shooting the new york times author richard p rez pe a and adam goldman text the two masked killers burst through a door and , without saying a word , swept the conference room with semiautomatic rifle fire , spraying more than 100 rounds before they fled , just two or three minutes later a new report chronicles in vivid detail the dec 2 terrorist attack in san bernardino , calif where syed rizwan farook and his wife , tashfeen malik , killed 14 people and wounded 24 others the couple pledged allegiance to the islamic state , committed the rampage and died hours later in a wild shootout with the police , when mr farook was shot 25 times and ms malik was hit 13 times the report contains the first official account of how the killers were identified and tracked down , with a handful of officers playing crucial roles and it reveals a wealth of specifics that had not been made public before , including the number of gunshots , and the horrors that officers and victims encountered the scene that police officers found minutes after the massacre overwhelmed the senses dozens of maimed or dead bodies , spattered and pooling blood , the haze and smell of gunfire , a shattered pipe pouring water from the ceiling , a wailing alarm and wounded victims pleading for help , clutching at officers whose first priority was to find the attackers the report was produced by the police foundation , a policy study group in washington , with help from the justice department and local law enforcement agencies the authors interviewed more than 200 people , from police chiefs to survivors after the new york times obtained a draft version and reported on its contents , the justice department on friday released the final document some details changed including the number of times the killers were shot , how many shots they fired and how their vehicle was traced but the overall picture was unaltered three men tried to stop the slaughter , rushing mr farook , but he shot all three , the earlier version of the report said it did not say whether the men survived the anecdote was left out of the final report , but a justice department official confirmed that it was correct the report shows how officers from multiple agencies handled a rapidly unfolding crisis , making decisions on the fly , often with little coordination or direction the results were quick , sometimes heroic responses that may have saved lives but also created confusion and mistakes , though none proved fatal perhaps most disturbing , more than six hours passed before officers searched a bag the killers had left at the scene of the shooting inside were three pipe bombs the victims were familiar with the site of the massacre , a conference room at the inland regional center where about 80 employees of the san bernardino county department of public health were attending a training session they had met there before in fact , many of them had attended training in that same room a year earlier mr farook , 28 , was born in the united states to parents from pakistan ms malik , 29 , was born in pakistan but had lived much of her life in saudi arabia after they met and married in 2014 in saudi arabia , she moved to the united states , obtained legal residence and gave birth to a daughter mr farook , a food inspector whose colleagues never suspected him of radicalism , put the bag with the bombs in the room and left he and his wife returned about half an hour later , shortly before 11 a m masked and clad in black , armed with rifles a civilian variant of the military rifle and semiautomatic pistols mr farook s rifle had been modified in a failed attempt to make it fully automatic the first people killed were two men sitting outside along the walkway to the conference room one was shot while eating at a picnic table the other was found with his cellphone still in his hand the couple then entered the conference room and opened fire , calmly emptying and reloading their rifles a county official quoted in the draft version of the report said he thought at first that it was the most glorified training i had ever seen , adding , probably on the second or third clip , it finally clicked that this wasn t an exercise some people ran through the far door , deeper into the building others ducked under tables or hid in bathrooms , closets and cupboards one woman dashed through the door the attackers had entered , but they shot her dead as she fled a bullet ripped through a wall and wounded a woman in another room one woman quoted in the earlier version of the report said that as she lay wounded , a female who had been shot in the head asked her to call her mother to say goodbye she tried to comfort the other woman , saying she was all right i m not , i m bleeding from the mouth , the colleague said before closing her eyes for good , the report said within six minutes of the first 911 call , san bernardino officers reached the center not a team , just the scattered few who arrived fastest one was riding in a car driven by a trainee when the call came , he took the wheel , sped to the scene , grabbed his shotgun and helmet , and told the trainee to hide thinking the attackers were still present , the first four officers entered the south side of the conference room they followed their training , arranging themselves like the points of a diamond they stuck to the guideline locate , isolate , evacuate , meaning find and neutralize the threat before helping victims officers from the county probation department quickly arrived and set up a triage area for the wounded the terror in their eyes was unbelievable it was scarier than the wounds , a probation sergeant said the draft version of the report quoted another sergeant describing a woman with a hole in her leg that was the size of a cereal bowl , who said , with a blank expression , i am going to die , please don t let me die a san bernardino swat team reached the scene within 11 minutes of the first call a second swat team , drawn from the police departments of surrounding cities , came shortly after soon there were legions of officers from several local agencies many of them heading to the scene without waiting for instructions , which produced a rapid response but also uncertainty about who was doing what the report describes confusion and missteps similar to those that marked the police response to other mass attacks , like the washington navy yard shooting in 2013 and the shooting at a movie theater in aurora , colo in 2012 but the authors of the report also praised san law enforcement agencies , noting that they had learned from previous episodes and had practiced working together the swat teams went room to room through the multiple buildings of the inland regional center , which houses social service agencies , but they had no protocol for marking which rooms had been searched officers stood outside with their guns trained on the second and third floors of one building , incorrectly suspecting that the shooters were hiding there so many emergency vehicles were parked at random angles that ambulances could not get close to the complex , and officers carried the wounded out despite the confusion , emergency workers got all of the wounded to hospitals within 57 minutes of the first 911 call inside the golden hour that experts say is a critical benchmark all of them survived investigators spent almost three hours inspecting a package on the second floor that proved harmless , but officers did not notice the bag containing the pipe bombs until 5 08 p m after the shootout with the terrorists , some officers said that while they were still trying to record the crime scene , federal agents were already removing evidence like weapons and a cellphone a rookie officer got a crucial piece of information while interviewing witnesses and forwarded it to his father , a police sergeant a county health worker had noticed that mr farook had left early and told the officer that there was just something about the shooter , from his body language to his body composition , that seemed familiar a search turned up several people in the region named syed farook , and officers were sent to all of the addresses after the police put out word that a black s u v had been seen leaving the center , several people called with tips , including one caller who had memorized a utah license plate a police department analyst found that the vehicle belonged to a rental car company and learned by calling the company that the s u v had been rented by a syed farook word went out on the radio that he lived a few minutes away , in the city of redlands among those responding was a san bernardino police narcotics team , but other officers did not know that the narcotics officers were undercover , driving unmarked cars and not talking on their radios , in case criminals were listening as they neared the redlands address , the narcotics officers saw the s u v and followed it one officer flagged down a passing redlands police sergeant and told him what was happening the sergeant put the information out over the police radio the sergeant and a sheriff s deputy joined the undercover officers following the couple after the couple drove back to san bernardino , the sergeant tried to pull them over , alerting them that they were being followed ms malik started shooting at the officers through the back window of the s u v mr farook then stopped the vehicle and stepped out , firing his rifle as his wife kept shooting from the back seat together they fired at least 81 shots and had almost 2 , 400 more rounds of ammunition , but as more officers arrived , they were heavily outgunned most of the shots that hit mr farook struck his legs , possibly because officers believed erroneously that the couple were wearing body armor two of the 13 rounds that hit ms malik struck her in the head the shootout lasted about three minutes , but in that time , 24 officers fired at least 440 rounds , riddling the s u v with bullet holes by the time it ended , more than 175 local , state and federal officers were at the scene remarkably , only two officers were hurt , each with a wound to the thigh one did not realize he had been hit until 13 hours later , when he took a shower",1.0

"title affordable care act sign ups dip amid uncertainty and trump attacks the new york times author robert pear text washington the number of people who signed up for health insurance in the federal marketplace that serves most states dipped this year to 9 2 million , the trump administration said friday , as consumers struggled with confusion over the future of the affordable care act that represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9 63 million people who signed up through healthcare gov at this time last year the numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the affordable care act , former president barack obama s signature health care law state reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people veterans of the obama administration said president trump s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll people may also have been influenced by signals from congress that the law would soon be repealed and some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans , which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states just before leaving office , the obama administration reported that through healthcare gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year , with 8 8 million as of jan 14 trump s sabotage worked , said ben wakana , who was a spokesman for sylvia mathews burwell , the secretary of health and human services under mr obama we were on track to exceed last year s total we expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period still , the numbers present a challenge to republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it the fourth annual open enrollment season began nov 1 and ended tuesday , 11 days after mr trump took office the trump administration scaled back publicity and advertising in the final days of the open enrollment period mr trump also issued a broadly worded executive order that directed federal officials to waive or delay any provision of the affordable care act that would impose a cost , fee , tax , penalty or regulatory burden on individuals the order , issued within hours of mr trump s inauguration on jan 20 , did not specify what actions would be taken but lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty mr trump has described the affordable care act as a complete and total disaster and has said he wants to replace it with better , cheaper coverage for everybody , but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah and chairman of the finance committee , who is trying to draft a replacement for the law , said that today s numbers failed to keep pace with last year s in addition , he suggested , some people who signed up will not pay their premiums and will therefore not have coverage this year either way , mr hatch said , enrollment numbers are down , and costs are up that response was predicted by representative nancy pelosi of california , the house minority leader and an architect of the law now , republicans will cynically point to the dip in enrollment they caused , declare the affordable care act broken and move to steal the affordable health coverage of every american , she said meanwhile , in states committed to delivering affordable health coverage to their residents , enrollment in the affordable care act s marketplaces has surged democrats will continue to stand our ground to ensure that every american has access to affordable health coverage , she added enrollment reports from the obama administration were invariably upbeat , saying the numbers showed that people needed and wanted insurance under the affordable care act the first report from the trump administration struck a different tone obamacare has failed the american people , with one broken promise after another , matt lloyd , a spokesman for the department of health and human services , said friday premiums in the a c a marketplace have increased 25 percent while the number of insurers has declined 28 percent over the past year of the 9 2 million people who signed up through healthcare gov , were new to the federal marketplace , and were returning customers the individual insurance market is in constant flux with changes in income and employment , consumers may gain or lose coverage from medicaid , employers and other sources of insurance the obama administration predicted in october that 13 8 million people would sign up for coverage in the enrollment period that ended this week the total appears likely to fall short of that goal leslie dach , a former obama administration official who is trying to preserve the health law as a leader of the protect our care coalition , said , enrollment was a success , and it would have been even higher without the trump administration s efforts to suppress enrollment despite those efforts , he said , americans continued to enroll in the final weeks , proving that there is considerable demand for quality and affordable coverage several states that run their own insurance exchanges appear to have done better than the federal marketplace in new york , 908 , 200 people signed up through the state marketplace for either a qualified health plan or the basic health program authorized by the affordable care act for people that represents an increase of 39 percent under the obama administration , enrollment in marketplace insurance plans was consistently lower than the levels originally projected by the congressional budget office , in part because consumers were more likely to get and keep

"title officer s murder trial in freddie gray death turns on rough ride the new york times author jess bidgood text baltimore in opening the state s case against caesar r goodson jr the driver of the police van in which freddie gray suffered the spinal cord injury that killed him , the prosecutor uttered two crucial words rough ride officer goodson , the prosecutor said , intended to bounce mr gray , a black man , around in the van that morning officer goodson , who is also black , is facing the toughest charge depraved heart murder of the six officers accused in mr gray s death and legal experts say the prosecution s chances of a conviction on that count hinge in large part on being able to prove that officer goodson intentionally , and with disregard for mr gray s life , drove him dangerously the defense rested its case friday , and closing arguments are set for monday but just before the state rested its case earlier this week , a crucial prosecution witness said he could not say whether a rough ride had occurred another indication of just how difficult the prosecution s case may be it has different names around the country , including screen test and nickel ride since it is a colloquial term , not a legal one , the precise definition can vary but , legal and policing experts say , there is an element of intent a rough ride is basically the police driving in such a manner to inflict injury or pain on the person being transported , said a dwight pettit , a lawyer in baltimore , who has represented dozens of plaintiffs in police brutality cases , because they have knowledge that the person is not secure in the vehicle and is usually handcuffed or possibly leg chained and therefore has no way to protect themselves geoffrey p alpert , a criminology professor at the university of south carolina , said the tactic was known anecdotally as a form of punishment for unruly prisoners normally , he said , it s just kind of , they end up with a few bruises or , worst case , it s a broken arm on wednesday , stanford franklin , a retired baltimore police officer who was the prosecution s key policing witness , listed some possible elements of a rough ride during sudden acceleration , sudden stops , quick turns it is difficult to assess the frequency of the practice , but cities including chicago , philadelphia and aurora , ill have settled lawsuits related to accusations of rough rides in baltimore , tessa president of the local branch of the n a a c p and mr pettit said they had both received complaints about rough rides , although they were not always substantiated in court those complaints have dropped off somewhat since mr gray s story took over the headlines , increasing scrutiny of the police and raising calls for working cameras inside police wagons charles j key , a retired baltimore police lieutenant , said that he never saw a single instance of a rough ride in 26 years of his career there , beginning in 1970 but in 1997 , a black man named jeffery alston was paralyzed during a ride in a baltimore police van in 2004 , he received a 6 million settlement from the city in 2005 , another black man , dondi johnson sr died after suffering a spinal fracture during a police ride a jury awarded his family more than 7 million , but the award was later reduced to 219 , 000 mr key testified as an expert witness in both cases officer goodson faces seven charges , including depraved heart murder meaning murder born of willful disregard for human life and three counts of manslaughter prosecutors allege that officer goodson failed to buckle mr gray s seatbelt or call for medical attention , which they say could have saved his life to them , those omissions were tantamount to a crime and they allege officer goodson rolled through a stop sign and took a sharp right turn so fast that the van could not stay in its lane he was injured because he got a rough ride , michael schatzow , a prosecutor , said during opening statements , adding , there was no good reason for the officer to repeatedly fail to seatbelt mr gray except to bounce him around legal experts said it could be difficult for the prosecution to secure a murder conviction against officer goodson without proving that a rough ride had occurred the rough ride is important , said david jaros , an associate professor of law at the university of baltimore , because it tells us something about the driver s mental state and his willingness to risk human life the state has presented evidence of mr gray s devastating injuries and with a detective , michael boyd , on the stand , prosecutors presented a series of surveillance videos showing the van making its way through baltimore but on tuesday , during matthew fraling , one of officer goodson s lawyers , asked detective boyd if he had observed the van at any point make an abrupt start , an abrupt stop , or an abrupt turn no , sir , detective boyd answered on wednesday , mr franklin , the prosecution witness , testified that leg shackles made it hard for passengers to brace themselves in a van , and that , without a seatbelt , your ability to limit yourself from being a projectile in that van is very limited it s extremely important , mr franklin added , that that ride be as smooth as possible to prevent the person in the back from being tossed to and fro mr gray s legs were shackled during most of the ride and he was not wearing a seatbelt , but prosecutors did not draw direct connections between those facts and mr franklin s testimony a point that officer goodson s lawyers sought to emphasize is it not your contention today that officer goodson in any way engaged in a rough ride \? mr fraling said mr franklin paused i can t say on wednesday , officer goodson s lawyers moved to have the charges dismissed while it is a common move by defendants , the lawyers focused on the rough ride during their oral arguments on thursday there was no evidence introduced by the state to support a theory that officer goodson gave mr gray a rough ride , said andrew graham , another lawyer for the officer , calling it a centerpiece of the state s argument when the judge , barry g williams , asked mr schatzow to elaborate on how the prosecution had supported its case , including the murder charge , the prosecutor turned not to the rough ride , but to what they said was officer goodson s failure to buckle mr gray s seatbelt on five different occasions , suggesting a possible pivot in the state s strategy five times is enough to demonstrate depraved heart , mr schatzow said later , judge williams asked mr schatzow if the state was acknowledging that it had not presented evidence of a rough ride the no 1 piece of evidence is the fact that the man suffered a broken neck , and it killed him , said mr schatzow , adding that that injury , combined with the limited video evidence and that mr gray was shackled , handcuffed and not wearing a seatbelt , made it possible to infer that a rough ride had occurred but , he added , a rough ride was not a necessary element of the charges there are lots of ways to cause people to move about the compartment in the van , he said judge williams allowed the case to continue with all the charges intact , but said it was a closer call to let the murder charge move forward mr jaros , the law professor , said that the rough ride theory had flatlined , but that doesn t mean that they don t have a case at least for manslaughter based on his failure to buckle and then his refusal to get medical attention there s no question , mr jaros said , that you ve got really a horrific level of callousness to the experience of the people who are being shuttled through the system the problem is , that doesn t necessarily satisfy a criminal charge",1.0
"title welsh reject e u , but its money will be missed the new york times author danny hakim text newport , wales david adams a painting business here his leanings in the recent referendum to leave the european union would seem obvious grants from the european union have funded many of the projects he works on , including the former bank branch he was painting last week in this city in southern wales european union funds also helped him hire apprentices , including his own son and wales gets back far more money from the european union than it pays in but many of the poorer places in britain that receive the most aid from europe also voted decisively to leave promises were made by the leaders of the leave campaign that exiting the european union would lead to a bonanza of money no longer being sent to brussels , the seat of the european government after the vote , they almost immediately retreated from those promises , leaving the future of aid programs funded by europe in peril even some in newport who knew what they stood to lose were conflicted over the vote we get more back than we put in , said mr adams , 52 , leaning against his van in spattered white work pants what the money has done is made the infrastructure of wales much better , everywhere s much more accessible because of the road infrastructure , things like that that s where all the e u money s gone even so , he said he could not bring himself to support staying in the union and chose not to vote , because the issue of immigration held him back at the end of the day , we re an island , he explained we can take only so much population one of the looming questions after the brexit vote is what happens to the money flowing into places like wales nearly 400 million in multiyear apprenticeship funding programs alone are underway , among a list of european projects earmarked for wales stretching to 2020 another program , with a budget of more than 180 million , helps start new small businesses and finance existing ones others fund a range of programs including advancing women s opportunities and projects on college campuses even so , 56 percent of voters in newport voted to leave one of the leave movement s core arguments was that britain could keep money it now pays to europe and use it for its own purposes boris johnson , the former london mayor who was one of the campaign s most visible leaders , even rode around on a bus with the false claim that britain pays europe 350 million a week painted on its side \( it s more like 150 million , or about 197 million , a week , according to the institute for fiscal studies \) the maneuver led the comedian john oliver to refer to mr johnson as a man with both the look , and the economic insight , of from the flintstones britain as a whole paid about 9 5 billion more annually into the european union than it got back over the last according to the british treasury after it leaves , it most likely will still have to pay money into the union to keep its trading privileges and the aid coming back will cease many in the british parliament insist on keeping some kind of access to the single market , the european system of rules and laws that seek to make trading among member states more seamless but some vying to be the next prime minister have suggested britain could operate outside the single market , though that could throw up myriad barriers to trade but keeping access as an outsider costs money , as it does for nonmember states like norway and switzerland norway pays about 40 percent more per capita to gain access to the single market than britain does now , according to data from the european commission a study by the house of commons library , which excluded european aid to private institutions like universities and businesses , found that norway paid 17 percent less than britain either way , britain is unlikely to get more favorable terms than it already has part of the problem is that norway and switzerland are part of the schengen area , a travel zone this kind of unfettered movement is exactly what many leave voters detest european leaders , hardly in a charitable mood , seem unlikely to do favors there will be no single market la carte , donald tusk , the european council president , said this week , while juncker , the president of the european commission , said that access to the single market was contingent on basic principles including the free movement of people many areas in britain favored with european aid are mired in poverty and voted in frustration in sunderland , a northeastern english city of once vibrant shipyards that has benefited from european aid , more than 61 percent backed the leave campaign the vote , though , has left the future of a local nissan plant in doubt cornwall , britain s southwestern tip , also receives significant european funding , including money seen as crucial to the development of a british spaceport shortly after cornwall voted to leave the union , the local council sought assurances that the funding that now comes from europe would continue , although britain would be hard pressed to make up the loss wales is one of the four nations that make up britain , but the only one besides england to support a european exit to outsiders , differences between wales and england can seem subtle , beyond the welsh language that accompanies english on its signs and its red dragon flag wales has lagged economically newport s economic struggles were visible downtown , part of the reason it has been a recipient of so much aid one pub advertised all pints for 1 99 , or about 2 70 , and there were a number of vacant storefronts , as well as a proliferation of charity stores , including one selling everything for 1 a curtain store asked to sign a petition to help fight an eviction notice during a visit , it did not take long to determine the leave campaign s appeal for a number of residents i m definitely not a racist , said thomas reynolds , an retired construction worker but he said he was delighted by the outcome muslims don t like christians i don t want muslims next to me , i prefer christian but they probably would think the same , so we re on the same page tom fereday , 28 , an unemployed office administrator and a supporter of the far right u k independence party , said he was uncomfortable with the growing muslim population in the city s pillgwenlly neighborhood i m happy to go through hard times if it means we get our national sovereignty back , he said , adding , to keep letting in thousands of muslim migrants is just complete insanity the disquieting racism the referendum has inflamed was tangible when a small group of young white men were heard briefly hooting monkey sounds as they walked past a black man on a downtown street but this was hardly a reflection of the whole city i m disgusted that we voted out , said hilary small , a retired medical secretary many voters , she said , simply were uninformed about the money the european union sends to the region a lot of the welsh people didn t realize that , she said dean jeffery beddis , 51 , the heavily tattooed owner of kriminal records , a shop in a downtown arcade , said , i don t think people knew the consequences of their vote , to be honest it s a mixture of things , ignorance , lack of education , fear and just not knowing , he said , denouncing the fear mongering of the sun , a tabloid , before turning his fire to boris johnson and then donald j trump a rug with president john f kennedy s image hung behind him russell thomas , mr adams s partner in the painting business , did vote to stay in the union a lot of the subsidies now we think will be stopped , he said it s a devastating blow i think , but

u s law requires the relocation of the embassy to jerusalem however , president obama signed successive waivers delaying the move the current waiver expires on june 1 numerous reports in recent days cited white house officials saying that trump is not expected to use the visit to announce an embassy move still , that prognosis is subject to change the president has not made a decision yet and is still reviewing that , white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said last week even if trump does not announce an embassy move , there are half measures that could be put into place , including the possibility of david friedman , the u s ambassador to israel , setting up shop at the u s consulate in jerusalem instead of the beachfront embassy building in tel aviv 2 will trump make policy declarations regarding the status of jerusalem \? it is not lost on observers that trump will be in jerusalem on jerusalem day , a national holiday here that marks israel s reunification of jerusalem after the 1967 six day war and the establishment of israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city , which include the old city , western wall and temple mount israel officially annexed jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognized by the international community because the palestinians claim eastern sections of the city for a future palestinian capital despite their never having had a state or entity in those areas current u s law does not officially recognize israeli control over the eastern sections of the city , going so far as to prevent american citizens born in jerusalem from listing israel as their country of birth all eyes will be on trump to see if he makes any declarations regarding israel s status in jerusalem 3 will trump announce the launch of new , u s negotiations \? there are currently no plans for trump to host a joint summit with israeli and palestinian leaders instead , the focus will be on whether trump plans to announce the relaunch of talks aimed at creating a palestinian state despite the palestinian authority s history of rejecting each previous israeli offer of a state and in recent years refusing to even come to the bargaining table these offers were made at camp david in 2000 , taba in 2001 , the annapolis conference in 2007 and again in 2008 in each of these cases , the pa refused generous israeli statehood proposals and bolted negotiations without counteroffers the pa also failed to respond to prime minister benjamin netanyahu s unprecedented attempts to negotiations aimed at creating a palestinian state , including freezing jewish construction in the west bank and eastern jerusalem , and releasing palestinian prisoners u s ambassador to israel david friedman said last week that the trump administration does not plan to impose preconditions for talks and wants the two parties to iron things out as you can see , in contrast to what happened in 2009 , when secretary of state hillary clinton demanded a complete settlement freeze and abbas still didn t show up to negotiate , here we have no demand for a settlement freeze and abbas is prepared to meet with the prime minister of israel without any preconditions , he stated there have been reports trump is seeking to talks for a period of six to twelve months without preconditions 4 will trump express support for a plan beyond the solution \? ever since the 1991 madrid conference and the largely failed 1993 oslo accords that legitimized yasser arafat as a peace partner , the u s and international community have upheld the two state solution as the only framework for negotiations that solution calls for the creation of a palestinian state with borders to be negotiated , but it is generally understood that such a state would encompass the gaza strip , major swaths of the west bank and a foothold in eastern jerusalem israeli frustration has grown after the pa turned down successive offers of a state and abbas s official government organs have continued to promote terrorism and the destruction of israel there has been widespread talk here about other ways to solve the conflict , although the israeli government has not officially proposed an alternative to the solution bucking the trends of the international community , trump last february stated that the u s is open to possibilities outside the framework i m looking at and and i like the one that both parties like i m very happy with the one that both parties like , trump said at a white house press briefing with prime minister benjamin netanyahu 5 will trump call on sunni arab countries to prod the palestinians into talks and make a deal that would create peaceful relations between israel and the countries of the larger mideast and persian gulf \? the tectonic plates have shifted in this region following eight years of the obama administration s failed mideast policies , especially the u s nuclear deal with iran sunni arab countries like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have reportedly been working behind the scenes with israel to tackle the iran threat , and relations between israel and sunni arab countries have grown warmer as a result last week , the washington post reported trump may use his trip to saudi arabia to unveil plans for a new arab nato a military alliance that would work to combat the threat of the islamic state and other terrorist groups trump could take advantage of these regional trends to nudge sunni arab countries not currently in a state of peace with israel \( only egypt and jordan have signed peace deals with the jewish state \) to come out of the closet and launch official diplomatic relations with israel instead of behind the scenes diplomacy trump could also include these arab countries in talks in hopes of forging a larger regional deal that goes beyond the conflict aaron klein is breitbart s jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter he is a new york times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program , aaron klein investigative radio follow him on twitter aaronkleinshow follow him on facebook",1.0

"title a remote pacific nation , threatened by rising seas the new york times author mike ives text tarawa , kiribati one clear bright day last winter , a tidal surge swept over an ocean embankment here in the remote , island country of kiribati , smashing through the doors and windows of betio hospital and spewing sand and debris across its maternity ward beero hosea , 37 , a handyman , cut the power and helped carry frightened mothers through the rubble and water to a nearby school if the next one is combined with a storm and stronger winds , that s the end of us , he said it s going to cover this whole island for years , scientists have been predicting that much of kiribati may become uninhabitable within decades because of an onslaught of environmental problems linked to climate change and for just as long , many here have paid little heed but while scientists are reluctant to attribute any specific weather or tidal event to rising sea levels , the tidal surge last winter , known as a king tide , was a chilling call it shocked us , said tean rube , a pastor with the kiribati uniting church we realized , o k maybe climate change is real pacific island nations are among the world s most physically and economically vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events like floods , earthquakes and tropical cyclones , the world bank said in a 2013 report while world powers have summit meetings to negotiate treaties on how to reduce and mitigate carbon emissions , residents of tiny kiribati , a former british colony with 110 , 000 people , are debating how to respond before it is too late much of kiribati , a collection of 33 coral atolls and reef islands scattered across a swath of the pacific ocean about twice the size of alaska , lies no higher than six feet above sea level the latest climate models predict that the world s oceans could rise five to six feet by 2100 the prospects of rising seas and intensifying storms threaten the very existence and livelihoods of large segments of the population , the government told the united nations in a report last year half of the village of bikenibeu , for instance , could be inundated by 2050 by rises and storm surges , according to a world bank study the study lays out kiribati s future in apocalyptic detail causeways would be washed away , crippling the economy degraded coral reefs , damaged by warming water , would allow stronger waves to slam the coast , increasing erosion , and would disrupt the food supply , which depends heavily on fish supported by the reefs higher temperatures and rainfall changes would increase the prevalence of diseases like dengue fever and ciguatera poisoning even before that , scientists and development experts say , rising sea levels are likely to worsen erosion , create groundwater shortages and increase the intrusion of salt water into freshwater supplies in response , kiribati \( pronounced in the local language \) has essentially been drawing up plans for its demise the government has promoted migration with dignity , urging residents to consider moving abroad with employable skills it bought nearly 6 , 000 acres in fiji , an island nation more than 1 , 000 miles away , as a potential refuge fiji s higher elevation and more stable shoreline make it less vulnerable anote tong , a former president who pushed through the fiji purchase , said it was also intended as a cry for attention from the world the issue of climate change is real , serious , and we d like to do something about it if they re going to take their time about it , he said in a recent interview but packing up an entire country is not easy , and may not be possible and many kiribati residents remain skeptical of the need to prepare for an eventuality that may be decades away the skeptics include the rural and less educated residents of the outer islands who doubt they could obtain the skills needed to survive overseas , and christians who put more faith in god s protection than in climate models according to their biblical belief , we re not going to sink because god is the only person who decides the fate of any country , said rikamati naare , the news editor at radio kiribati , the broadcaster as president tong became a celebrity , invited to speak at conferences around the world , opponents accused him of ignoring problems back home , such as high unemployment and infant mortality they derided the fiji purchase , for nearly 7 million , as a boondoggle dismissed his migration with dignity as a contradiction in terms and called his talk of rising sea levels alarmist and an affront to divine will mr tong , having served three terms , was not allowed to run for this year , but in march elections the opposition defeated his party the new president , taneti maamau , said he planned to shift priorities most of our resources are now diverted to development , but in fact there are also bigger issues , like population , the health of the people , the education of the people , he said during an interview at parliament , which sits on reclaimed land at the edge of a turquoise lagoon climate change is a serious issue , but you can t do very much about it , especially if a big hurricane comes , he added with a hearty laugh the fiji purchase was not the first effort to address kiribati s perilous future the world kiribati adaptation program , begun in 2003 , developed plans , built coastal sea walls , planted mangroves and installed systems the bank says the project , which cost 17 7 million , has conserved fresh water in tarawa and protected about one mile of kiribati s 710 miles of coastline but a 2011 report cast doubt on whether the world bank project helped kiribati prepare for climate change and while the mangroves and water management plans have helped , a 2014 study said the first round of sea walls , made of sandbags , had proved counterproductive and caused more erosion adaptation is just this long , ugly , hard slog , said the study s lead author , simon donner , a professor of geography at the university of british columbia in vancouver the idea that an outside organization can just come in with money , expertise and ideas and implement something easily is na ve what you need is consistent , funding the type of stuff that s hard to pull off with development aid denis jordy , a senior environmental specialist at the world bank , acknowledged that we had some issues with the first sea walls but said subsequent ones made of rock were better designed there is no shortage of ideas to avert kiribati s environmental fate china s construction of artificial islands in the south china sea shows the promise of sophisticated technology , experts say mr tong commissioned a study on raising kiribati s coastline but such measures are financially unrealistic for a country like kiribati it s not about the place going underwater , professor donner said , noting that some of kiribati s islands had actually grown in recent years because of land reclamation or natural coastal dynamics it s about it becoming prohibitively expensive to live in that s the real challenge for kiribati the parallel freshwater crisis is also fixable , at a cost clean drinking water is already scarce on several islands , and saltwater from high ocean tides has infiltrated some wells many residents of south tarawa , home to half the country s people , now get their drinking water exclusively from rainwater tanks experts worry that as sea levels rise , kiribati s fragile groundwater supply will face even greater risks , while the next drought could quickly exhaust the municipal supply and household rainwater tanks kiribati could invest in desalinization equipment or ship in drinking water , but this is a country with only one paved road it s all doable , said doug ramsay , the pacific rim manager at the national institute of water and atmospheric research in new zealand it s just going to be a very expensive exercise another novel response gaining attention lately is the idea of applying international refugee law largely drafted after world war ii to protect people fleeing political , religious or racial persecution to those forced from their homes because of climate change in 2012 , a migrant worker from kiribati , ioane teitiota , applied for asylum in new zealand , arguing that he was unable to grow food or find potable water in kiribati because of saltwater intrusion his lawyer , michael kidd , said the distinction between environmental and political refugees was arbitrary you re either a refugee or you re not , he said in an interview the courts rejected the argument , and mr teitiota was deported from new zealand last year mr kidd said he had appealed to the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights still , migration may become increasingly important mr tong said he hoped to prepare his people to move with programs that would meet standards recognized in australia and new zealand the science of climate change is not 100 percent precise , he said in the interview but we know without any argument that , in time , our people will have to relocate unless there are very , very significant resources committed to maintain the integrity of the land coastal threats are increasingly clear to residents of buariki , an oceanside village of huts and towering coconut palms on the island of north tarawa erosion along the beach has already toppled dozens of coconut trees the world bank estimates that 18 to 80 percent of the village , which sits on a peninsula not more than a few hundred feet wide , may be underwater by 2050 some villagers said they were resigned to leaving our government already has land in fiji for the kiribati people , so if there are more high tides here , they ll bring people to live there , said kourabi ngauea , 29 but it depends on the government , and if they can support us others see no need to leave this is where i belong , aroita tokamaen , 76 , said as she peeled a coconut on her patio i would rather stay the tide that damaged the hospital here last winter was an exceptionally strong king tide , a surge that occurs twice a year when the moon is closest to the earth the waves also flooded the outdoor meeting space of the local branch of the kiribati uniting church while some people were alarmed , the pastor , ms rube , said she refused to accept the idea that kiribati could disappear we are christians , she said so we don t believe that god could have given us this world and then take it

"title fake news huffpo invents a steve bannon war on pope francis author rebecca mansour text the huffington post stooped to innuendo , slurs , and outright fabrication to manufacture out of whole cloth a dark conspiracy by donald trump s chief strategist stephen k bannon against pope francis piggybacking on a baseless new york times article by jason horowitz that imagined close ties between bannon and traditionalists in the vatican , huffington post writer michele somerville goes still further , alleging that bannon is aligning himself with the fringe of roman catholicism in order to wage a war on pope francis in her breathtaking ignorance , somerville bases her entire thesis on an outright error she mistakes steve bannon s 2014 reference to the church militant a common catholic expression referring to christians on earth as opposed to those who have already died for a traditionalist website by the same name although bannon has no connection whatsoever with the website or its theories about catholic doctrine , somerville concocts a nefarious link between the two , attributing the website s ideas to bannon himself throughout the rambling piece , somerville lays out in great detail some of the more absurd ideas advocated by the church militant website , and by association suggests that bannon must hold to the same theories she seems ignorant of the fact that bannon is unaware of the existence of the website and furthermore couldn t care less about its doctrinal nitpicking somerville s first mistake was giving credence to horowitz s new york times piece , which alleged that bannon visited the vatican in 2014 to cultivate strategic alliances with those in rome who share his interpretation of a church militant theology if somerville had employed even a minimum of journalistic she would have quickly found that the horowitz piece on the connection was built on air although horowitz alleges close ties between bannon and traditionalists in the vatican , he doesn t cite a single vatican official in the entire piece and instead relies on his fertile imagination to construct a web of alliances that do not exist in fact , when horowitz floated his theory to breitbart s rome bureau chief , dr thomas williams , williams assured him that it had no basis in fact and that bannon had never pursued alliances in the vatican and had no interest in influencing church affairs despite this advice , horowitz chose to publish the story anyway in point of fact , when bannon visited rome in april 2014 , he only met with one vatican official cardinal raymond burke , who at the time was head of the vatican s supreme court as the highest ranking american in the vatican and a conservative besides , burke was sought out by bannon not for a meeting but for an interview as part of breitbart s media outreach this was their sole meeting moreover , despite horowitz s statement to the contrary , at the time of their meeting there had been no conflict between cardinal burke and pope francis , and bannon was not attempting to stoke divisions within the church bannon pursued the idea of a rome bureau for breitbart news in 2014 because of his belief that politics is downstream of culture and that the moral voice of the catholic church has a powerful impact on the rest of the world in hiring breitbart s rome bureau chief , bannon chose not a or an but dr thomas williams , a theologian and former catholic priest who has since written literally hundreds of articles on pope francis and the vatican , nearly all of which have been sympathetic to the pope unable to mount an argument , somerville instead descends to insults and baseless slurs , calling bannon an catholic who only collaborates with jews in order to achieve the greater good of defeating islam she similarly attempts to tar him as a proponent of or roman catholicism , whatever that means bannon wants a war and he will use jesus to get one , somerville ominously warns fake news at its finest",1.0

osama bin laden , mr carlin joked the f b i is looking for explosives they should be looking for minute traces of rice and bok choy if timing is everything , mr carlin had nothing fifteen years later , his lost special is finally being released \( it is on sirius xm , though it will be for sale as a download or on cd or vinyl on sept 16 , at amazon and itunes , among other outlets \) it will be a revelation for comedy fans nostalgic for the days when you could expect a series of articulate salvos from mr carlin about every two years this special is not bonus track material it s a polished hour of new jokes with a virtuosic centerpiece , an intricate and elusive nearly story that inspired its title , firmly in the tradition of mr carlin s comedy but also a fascinating departure mr carlin , who died in 2008 , had always been a comic whose skepticism of government would be right at home with the tea party in a 1999 special , he even ridiculed airport security as a pointless charade , saying americans are always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the illusion of security but like so many other people , he was transformed by sept 11 he released an entirely new special only two months after the attack complaints and grievances in which he talks more about survival than freedom , setting up one premise by saying that dire events call for us to cooperate with unsavory people like george w bush mr carlin s more tentative attitude toward the government is a reminder of the anxiety about even doing comedy after sept 11 all the hosts went off the air for days multiple journalists wrote eulogies for irony and there was a sense among some that it was almost unseemly to respond to the attack in cultural terms today , we have a more accelerated news coverage and politicized comedy scene no one canceled a show after the june attack on a nightclub in orlando , fla and the sober way hosts speak after national tragedies has hardened into something like ritual , a part of the job in i kinda like it , mr carlin addressed mass killings in a way that seemed on the surface out of touch with the tragedy that followed in a cavalier tone , he says that he enjoys news of disasters the way a sports fan raves about seeing breaking records an earthquake , he says in an accent , put up some really big numbers , adding that he s always rooting for a really high death toll while this can seem like cheap provocation compared with his more famous bits , like the one inveighing against the seven words you can t say on television , gleefully imagining mass destruction had been a regular part of his for years i watch television news for one thing only entertainment , he said in jammin in new york , his 1992 special my favorite thing is accidents and fires i m not interested in the budget you show me a hospital on fire and i m a happy guy what mr carlin is doing here is satirizing american blood lust , bringing to the surface the impulse that makes professional wrestling and crime stories so popular as he put it more bluntly in 1992 , at least i admit it i kinda like it adds a more baroque voice to this satire of our dark , repressed thrills after saying that he enjoys the excitement of people dying , then comparing massacres and natural disasters in the voice of a demented sociopath , mr carlin imagines the apex of calamity , putting every disaster movie to shame his dizzyingly dense story includes flood , power failure , traffic jams , global warming , cholera , typhoid fever and a conflagration that wipes out north america and then things go really bad shifting into a cosmically fantastical mode , mr carlin imagines this disaster leading to the breakdown of the molecular structure of the atmosphere and changing the laws of nature burning clouds of flaming rain fly upward , the moon explodes and the dead return to life there s a literary quality to the grotesque and often surreal imagery of this story \( mr carlin developed material in performance but began on the page \) leaving behind punch lines and aiming for an almost metaphysical sense of the absurd in which people are inconsequential specks in a vast lovecraftian universe what really distinguishes this from mr carlin s previous work is that it becomes totally unhinged from logic he was nothing if not a rigorous thinker , who made you laugh by finding his way through arguments that led to outrageous conclusions like his brief against the sanctity of life , zeroing in on exceptions \( doesn t apply to cancer cells , does it \? you rarely see a bumper sticker that says save the tumors \) while arguing that it s really driven by the of the living but in i kinda like it , his arguments gradually unravel , deconstruct and are interrupted by supernatural details and then pure nonsense what begins as satire devolves into madness , culminating in a nightmarish dinner party attended by bitter , resentful zombies , all named uncle dave at the end of this parade of catastrophes , these bitter men gather around a table and spew resentments about their children , parents , the government and minorities their disgust spins out of them into what mr carlin describes as a swirling pool of hate that expands beyond the universe and explodes in a kind of second big bang the new world that emerges is utopian , and every uncle dave wins the lottery every week out of disaster comes nirvana this operatic yarn is less argumentative than most of mr carlin s bits , more open to interpretation one way to see it , though , is as a sendup of the terrorist that led to the attack on the world trade center and other sites that day , a biting take on an extremist view that imagines that a twisted form of deliverance will come from violence and hate seen from a certain angle , a story once too provocative to release might be the perfect example of comedy in the 11 world",1.0
