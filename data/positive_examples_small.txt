As Twitchy reported, Hillary Clinton held a brief press conference Friday to address news that the FBI had found — in the process of investigating Anthony Weiner’s alleged sexting of a 15-year-old girl — new emails that warranted further investigation into her own email scandal. 
Obviously not pleased by this latest development, Clinton called on the FBI to release whatever it had. Hillary Clinton: ""We don't know the facts, which is why we're calling on the FBI to release all the information it has … let’s get it out."" 
— New York Post (@nypost) October 28, 2016 
Despite that not being how FBI investigations work, Hillary’s call for the FBI to lay its cards on the table inspired Sharyl Attkisson of Full Measure News to make a simple suggestion: There's no mystery as to what's in the Huma Abedin emails–to Huma. She can fill in the Hillary campaign. 
— Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) October 29, 2016 
What didn’t Hillary think of that? Abedin is right there with her on board her campaign plane — it’s not like she’s hard to track down. Unless, of course, neither one can recall what they wrote to each other. It happens. More than 1,000 potentially relevant emails found on Weiner computer, including some between Huma and HRC. https://t.co/hVHL61vqrk

"title: Life: Inspiring: This Young Girl Still Gets To Dream Of Being The First Female President author: nan text: Email 
If this story doesn’t put a smile on your face, literally nothing will. 
Kimberly Kovax, an 11-year-old girl from Allentown, PA has been interested in politics and government from a very young age, and she followed the historic campaign of Hillary Clinton closely. But, when Hillary lost on Tuesday, that meant something incredible for Kimberly: She still gets to dream of being the first female president. 
Wow! This must be a truly special moment for Kimberly. 
The moment Hillary Clinton made her concession speech Wednesday morning, Kimberly’s opportunity to become the first woman elected to the Oval Office opened right back up. Though it may not be for 40, 50, maybe even 60 years, this key milestone in feminism is all Kimberly’s to aspire toward. 
Some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before Kimberly’s even eligible to run, but if the 2016 election is any indication, it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the Oval Office. Who knows? Kimberly could even be the first female president to re-legalize abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned at some point in the next four years! 
It must feel truly incredible for girls in America to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table, theirs for the eventual taking. The fact that America’s ugliest, most intolerant tendencies prevailed over Clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement, and it doesn’t get more powerful than that. 
Yup, we’re uplifted as hell right now—you go, Kimberly! When the time comes, you can certainly count on our vote."
"title: Churkin: Kiev lacks the humanity and courage to apologize to Donbass author: Jafe Arnoldski (noreply@blogger.com) text: October 26, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Antifashist - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, is sure that the bloodshed in South-East Ukraine could be avoided if the country’s authorities apologized to the population of the DPR and LPR like Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko proposed. 
The Russian diplomat said this in commenting on the statement of the Verhkovna Rada’s vice speaker, Irina Gerashchenko, made at a meeting of the UN Security council in which the Kiev representative once again accused Russia of aggression against Ukraine. In addition, the Ukrainian politician called Savchenko “the most famous prisoner of the Kremlin freed in exchange for military personnel from the Russian Army.” 
“In her speech, Ukraine’s representative mentioned Nadezhda Savchenko. After being pardoned, she returned to her homeland where she stated that Kiev should apologize to the residents of Donetsk and Lugansk. It is a pity that Ukrainian authorities don’t have enough humanity or political courage to do so,” Churkin said. 
According to Churkin, the inter-Ukrainian crisis would have been resolved long ago if Kiev didn’t attempt time and time again to change the Minsk Agreements. He stressed: “There would have been no conflict in Donbass if Kiev had not opted for armed suppression of the dissent that arose after a coup backed by foreign forces was carried out in the country.”  

Russia’s UN representative added that for two years already “Ukrainian security forces have shelled residential areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, as a result of which civilians, including women and children, have been killed.” He referred to the UN High Commissioner for Human Right’s report on abductions and torture to which Ukrainian forces have subjected women.

"title: US Officials See No Link Between Trump and Russia author: Jason Ditz text: Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   
With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign’s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D – NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret “explosive” evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. 
FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they’ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. 
The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming “everyone knows” that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI’s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven’t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. 
The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn’t stop Clinton from calling Trump a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday’s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. 
With Clinton’s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won’t be happening.  "

In this week’s episode of “Informed Rant,” the podcast of Joshua Scheer, Scheer speaks with Reece Jones, associate professor of Geography at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, about Jones’ book, “V iolent Borders: Refugees and the Right to Move ” and the human cost of borders. 
Scheer also speaks with Paul Jay, co-founder and editor in chief of The Real News, about the site’s significance, and Robert Holden, deputy director of the National Congress of American Indians, about racism and sports mascots after the world series. 
A rushed transcript follows. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Joshua Scheer: My guest right now is Professor Reece Jones, he’s a geopolitical expert. He teaches geography at the University of Hawaii Manila. His book is “Violent Borders”. We’re discussing refugees. Thank you for joining me. 
Reece Jones: Thanks for having me on. 
Scheer: You ask this question in the book, and obviously every day there’s some big story about migrants and refugees and what’s happening in the world. We just saw it yesterday with the so-called jungle being torn down in France. This morning I woke up to the BBC saying 238 migrants may have drowned outside of Libya. You study this, talking about limiting the movements of the poor and you ask this question in the beginning of your book. Talk about this. The limiting of the movements of these refugees and what you’ve seen, both in your field research, but also in the media reports and everything else that we’re all seeing right now. We’ve seen over the last, certainly the last few years, but this is not a new movement as you write about in your book. 
Jones: I’ve been studying borders for about 15 years now, and over that period of time, I’ve seen two big changes happening at borders. The first is the construction of a lot of border infrastructure that is designed to limit the movement of people across border spaces and to deter people from trying to make trips across borders. This infrastructure is both the deployment of a lot more border agents at borders, the use of new surveillance technologies and military technologies in border spaces, but it’s probably most evident if you look at walls. 
Walls are a good way to symbolize the hardening of borders that’s happened in the past 15 years. In 1990 there were about 15 border walls around the world, so relatively few. Today there are almost 70 walls on borders around the world, so there’s been a dramatic increase in the number of walls. Those walls symbolize all of the other infrastructure that goes along with that. The militarization of the security in these spaces. 
The second trend that I’ve noticed that goes along with that is a dramatic increase in the number of people dying at borders. If you look at the edges of the European Union, in the 1990s there were less than a hundred deaths per year at the edges of the EU, whereas in the past decade, those numbers have gone up dramatically. We’re talking about in the last 3 years in a row, over 3,500 people have died at the edges of the EU every single year. 
That’s part of a global trend. From 2005 to 2014, 40,000 people globally died trying to cross the border. In the last 2 years, as you mentioned during your introduction, that’s increased even more. Over 10,000 people have died trying to cross a border in just 2015 and 2016. 
Scheer: Yes, and you have the number in ... A lot of numbers in your book, and it’s very interesting walls. Can you explain, we’re going to get into the violence aspect, but explain this concept that was foreign to me, humanitarian fencing which you saw in Spain and elsewhere. What is humanitarian fencing? How does that relate? 
Jones: In some border areas, there’s an effort to construct fencing that is meant to deter people from crossing rather than injure them in the crossing process. If you look at the US fence, the one that was built after the Secure Fence Act passed in 2006, it doesn’t have a lot of barbed wire on it, instead it’s a wall, it prevents movement, but it doesn’t have the ways to injure people crossing. The EU fencing in Spain for example, is also similar in that respect. It doesn’t have all the barbed wire that we see in other borders around the world. 
That doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have a dangerous effect on people’s lives, because what we see over and over again is that as particular border crossing routes are closed, fences are always built in the easier places for people to cross between cities, it diverts people to ever more dangerous routes. That’s why there’s been this dramatic increase in deaths, because as borders become harder to cross, we’ve seen that it doesn’t deter people from crossing as it was predicted to do. Instead, it forces them to cross in these very dangerous places, which means the deserts of the US Southwest. 
In Arizona for example, where the number of deaths increased dramatically as fences were built on the US border. At the edges of the EU it means the people are crossing in the Mediterranean. They’re having to go to Libya, and having to use smugglers and are put in these very dangerous situations, which results in these really high death rates of people trying to cross into Europe. 
Scheer: My guest is Reece Jones, he’s a geography professor at the University of Hawaii Manila, and his book is Violent Borders, Refugees and the Right to Move. This is not a new concept as you write about though. The Great Wall of China you write about, Hadrian’s wall, it created a defensive control. Good taxes, and let’s get into that a little bit. The walls that were created, like for the Great Wall of China, and then with feudal lords and common lands using hedges and other mechanisms. 
We start to shift the conversation into the state’s responsibility, because as you write in your book, this is not ... One, as you write or as other geographers have also written, to be modern is to be ... Modern citizen it to be a mobile citizen, and also we have been always in migration. Our history’s in migration. Let’s talk about the history of basically creating walls and then where we have reached today in which states are protecting us and we have this national identity based on borders. 
Jones: What I argue in the book, the broader argument that I make in the book is that the walls that we see today and all of the security infrastructure that goes along with them at borders, the idea of citizenship, the use of passports, the imposition of border patrols, is new in the way that it’s happening at borders, but I argue that it’s part of a much longer term history that’s part of this contest between people moving around and states’ efforts to try to control that movement. 
I argue that a powerful historical process is the state using movement restrictions to contain the poor to particular places to lower their wages to to make them have no wages. What we see today is part of that longer history. In the past it was things like slavery, or serfdom, or vagrancy laws or poor laws, that kept the poor locked into particular places and allowed the wealthy to access their wages to they work at low wages or no wages. Today we see that with borders. 
The poor are restricted to the countries of their birth and this creates pools of low-wage labor that lets corporations move factories to locations where it’s advantageous to them, but doesn’t allow workers to move to places where they could demand higher wages. What I argue in the book is that the violence we see at borders today is part of that effort to contain the poor to particular places to protect the privileges and wealth that have accrued in other places."

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says Britain should keep its “options open” on whether or not to leave the European Union until after Brexit talks with the bloc are completed. 
During an interview on Friday with BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program, Blair described the EU referendum as “a catastrophe” and said UK voters should be given the option of a second EU referendum. 
Britain should not withdraw from the EU until it becomes clearer how Brexit would impact UK’s economic, social and cultural future, Blair said. 
“The bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still don’t know the precise terms,” he said. “There’s got to be some way, either through parliament, or through an election, possibly through another referendum, that people express their view.”

"title: Turkey’s Rivalry With Kurds Likely to Complicate Raqqa Invasion author: Jason Ditz text: Turkey Repeatedly Demanded US Not Allow Kurds to Participate by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
US officials are making clear that they intend to invade Raqqa really soon, with the ISIS capital scheduled to be attacks in the middle of the ongoing offensive against the city of Mosul. But while the Mosul invasion has a coalition of at least sort of friendly factions participating. No such coalition exists for Raqqa. 
Indeed, the US has insisted that the Kurdish YPG will be the overwhelming majority of the force, because they’re the only force available in the area with enough fighters to realistically attack the city. Yet Turkey has been outright livid over this, and has repeatedly demanded that the Kurds not be allowed anywhere near Raqqa. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists his country will be invading Raqqa, along with the YPG-held city of Manbij, very soon, and while they’ll doubtless also do some fighting against ISIS on the way, it’s pretty clear this is going to include some heavy fighting with the Kurds . 
That’s likely to complicate, and potentially outright derail, the invasion of Raqqa, as the Kurdish YPG can’t fight ISIS and Turkey at the same time, and the US seems wholly incapable of keeping Turkey from launching attacks on the Kurds in the middle of anti-ISIS operations.

"title: Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress author: nan text: Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress 
Rebels are doing a lot of dying but not taking much ground so far Print Originally appeared at The Moon of Alabama 
For four days now al-Qaeda in Syria (aka Jabhat al Nusra aka Fatah al-Sham) and assorted other ""rebel"" groups have tried to attack Aleppo from the west to break the siege on al-Qaeda associated groups in east-Aleppo. The New York Times in now openly admitting that CIA supported groups are acting under al-Qaeda's operational command. The piece though, which belonged on page one, was in the back of the paper. There is no public outcry over this disturbing fact. 
The attack on west-Aleppo had been talked about for over two weeks and the defenders are well prepared. waleppoattack.jpg 

As can be seen on the map above the areas al-Qaeda and its allies managed to capture so far are only small rural outskirts. Every attempt to attack actual city estate under roof was repelled by the defenders. Small infiltrations like shown in the map were immediately cleaned up. The marked area is back in the hands of the Syrian army. It is estimated that the several thousand attackers have so far lost more than 500 men. A 1,000 more are likely injured. Every attack has to be carried over mostly open land and is received by heavy artillery fire. Air attacks ravage their supply and preparation ares. 
The attackers launched over 20 suicide-vehicle bombs so far but only a few reached their targets and their damage was limited. Yesterday one suicide vehicle bomb, ready to be launched for a new attack, was hit by a missile from a Syrian helicopter and exploded at its preparation and launching position. Over 60 ""rebels"" were killed by it and their attack had to be call off. 
The good news is that the defense is holding. The bad news is that the al-Qaeda ""rebels"" received huge amounts of artillery missiles and launchers from their ""western"" and Gulf sponsors. Several hundred have been launched at the densely populated areas of west-Aleppo. More than a 100 civilians have been killed by them and several hundred civilians were wounded. Some of the missiles contained gas and people had to be taken to hospital with extreme breathing difficulties. The UN envoy condemned these attacks as ""possible war crimes"". 
The whole attack operation was launched under the direct supervision of al-Qaeda in Syria leader Abu Muhammad al-Golani. He was shown in pictures at the ""rebel"" headquarter of the attack discussing further operations. 
Despite any progress on their part the al-Qaeda forces seem far from giving up. More attacks to break the siege are expected. We can be sure that some of their surprises are still in store. But the defenders are ready and the Syrian army is said to prepare for a large counter operation which may include a serious effort to liberate east-Aleppo of the al-Qaeda occupation. 
Other fronts in Syria are relatively quiet. The Turks have been told by Russia to stop all air attacks within Syria. The message has been received. The Turkish plan to occupy Al Bab east of Aleppo is unlikely to happen as it would be out of range of the Turkey based artillery and have no air support. The U.S. would like to go to Raqqa but has no proxy ground force to do that. Some Obama officials are now arguing for more U.S. boots on the ground in Syria. Will Obama agree to that mission creep?"
"title: It’s Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post author: Amanda Shea text: It’s Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton 
Social media seems to be a tricky tool for Hillary Clinton, as she made a major mistake in what she shared online when she was either inebriated or hopped up on medication to treat what’s been plaguing her throughout this election. Shocked viewers couldn’t believe what was seen in her post, which she didn’t catch until it was way too late. 
Although we’ve seen how good Hillary is at hitting the “delete” button, she didn’t get to it quick enough after what she mindlessly posted that proved what Americans have suspected. Evidently, she didn’t realize she was making a point against herself when she made the comment with the post that said, “A guide to help you make your choice for president,” which mad the mistake all the worse for her. 
Either Hillary takes full responsibility for being corrupt by apparently admitting to it, or the person that does her social media is paying a big price today. Without reading what she was sharing, Hillary blindly posted an article from the super liberal news site, Slate, assuming that if it was from them, it was pro-Hillary, when the title of the piece called her out for being one of the “most corrupt, least popular candidates of all time.” A guide to help you make your choice for president. https://t.co/QzK7XZYmJW 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Urging her followers in the comment with the post to use it as a guide for making the best presidential pick, it was the best and most honest advice she’s ever given. It’s for this reason that the post was likely an accident since we all know that Hillary is incapable of being truthful, but karma, in this case, ensured she was. The irony of the situation isn’t lost on conservatives but apparently was on Slate, whose piece was actually meant to promote the Democratic candidate but came across as just the opposite. 
The truth has a sneaky way of coming out as it did in this headline, which calls attention to this woman’s lack of character and qualifications for the presidency. For once, there’s finally some common ground conservatives have found within this liberal publication’s pages, and that’s that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and incapable of being a leader."

"title: ‘A noun, a verb and Donald Trump’: Rubio seeks to seize on Murphy’s flaw author: Howard Portnoy text: Print 
As Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy squared off in the final debate of their Florida Senate race, the discussion turned to the Syrian civil war. Rubio, a former presidential candidate and member of the Senate intelligence committee, challenged his rival’s understanding of the factions on the ground. Murphy, a two-term congressman, reverted to a familiar line. 
“It just goes back to the same point,” he said, “that Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump, and it is shameful that he stands there with him.” 
The audience laughed, faintly, at one of nearly 20 mentions of the Republican presidential nominee during the one-hour debate. When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani : “A noun, a verb and Donald Trump: that’s his answer to everything.” 
The race in Florida, among the most closely watched in the country, could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate."
"title: Comment on Will The FBI Email Investigation Shed New Light On The Lolita Express And Other Clinton Sex Scandals? by mleblanc138 author: mleblanc138 text: Archives Michael’s Latest Video Will The FBI Email Investigation Shed New Light On The Lolita Express And Other Clinton Sex Scandals? By Michael Snyder, on October 31st, 2016 
Could it be possible that the newly discovered Clinton emails that the FBI is currently examining contain evidence of crimes other than just the mishandling of classified documents? For years, there have been shocking allegations about the sexual behavior of both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the conservative media, but neither Bill nor Hillary has ever been convicted of a sexual crime. However, that may be about to change. There is nobody on the planet that has been closer to Hillary Clinton over the past decade than Huma Abedin, and now the FBI has their hands on approximately 650,000 emails that were stored on electronic devices owned by her and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Without a doubt, many of those emails will relate to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents, but many of those emails will also be personal in nature. So what will the FBI learn about the Clinton sex scandals from those emails, and will that information be shared with the American public? 
In particular, any information regarding Clinton ties to Jeffrey Epstein and “the Lolita Express” could be extremely explosive. 
Bill and Hillary Clinton were both very good friends of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein before he was convicted of soliciting sex from a young girl in 2008. In fact, flight records show that Bill Clinton was a frequent passenger on Epstein’s plane that eventually came to be known as “the Lolita Express”… 
Bill Clinton took repeated trips on the “ Lolita Express “—the private passenger jet owned by billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein—with an actress in softcore porn movies whose name appears in Epstein’s address book under an entry for “massages,” according to flight logbooks obtained by Gawker and published today for the first time . The logs also show that Clinton shared more than a dozen flights with a woman who federal prosecutors believe procured underage girls to sexually service Epstein and his friends and acted as a “potential co-conspirator” in his crimes . 
Overall, Bill took at least 26 trips on board “the Lolita Express”. Fox News says that the plane “earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.” 
But sex with underage girls didn’t just happen on the plane. One of the favorite destinations for “the Lolita Express” was Epstein’s 72-acre “Orgy Island”. Here is more from Fox News … 
“Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called “TrafficKing.” “Why would a former president associate with a man like that?” 
Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands . 
Are you starting to understand how serious this could be? 
If Bill Clinton had sex with an underage girl just one time, that would be enough to potentially send him to prison for the rest of his life. 
Court records show that Jeffrey Epstein had 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton. To say that they were close would be a massive understatement. 
And what was the nature of Hillary Clinton’s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein? 
There are so many unanswered questions, and I don’t know what these 650,000 emails are going to show. But there are persistent whispers that law enforcement officials that were looking through them for the Anthony Weiner case found something big. 
And the truth is that the FBI would have never renewed this investigation so close to the election unless a gamechanger had been discovered. FBI Director James Comey had to know that he was going to take a tremendous amount of heat for this decision, and to move forward on something like this without good reason would be career suicide. 
For the moment, Hillary Clinton is putting on a brave face. On Monday, she challenged the FBI to hurry up and read her emails so that they could see that she had nothing to hide… 
With eight days remaining until Election Day, Hillary Clinton told a crowd of supporters here Monday that the FBI should hurry up and check out the additional emails that agents said they found while investigating the estranged husband of one of her aides. 
“Go ahead. Look at them,” the Democratic nominee said about the emails that may have been originally housed on a private server she used as secretary of state — a revelation that has thrown the presidential election into turmoil. 
Maybe Clinton is telling the truth, but with her you just never know. As I recently explained to a live studio audience down at Morningside , Hillary Clinton is a habitual liar and it is hard to trust her about anything at this point. 
If she is lying about these emails, hopefully we will find out very quickly. 
Her opponent, Donald Trump, seems energized by this new scandal, and he is warning that America may be facing a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton wins the election… 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, buoyed by tightening polls and a renewed controversy over Democrat Hillary Clinton, told an enthusiastic crowd in suburban Grand Rapids Monday that the U.S. could face a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton is elected president on Nov. 8. 
Trump predicted a “protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial,” and said “nothing will get done.” 
FBI Director James Comey has “brought back his reputation” by reactivating an investigation into the handling of her State Department e-mails , Trump said to loud cheers. 
But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that we could potentially be facing something much more serious than just a “constitutional crisis”. 
If the FBI finds evidence of very serious crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, she could actually be forced to withdraw from the race on the eve of the election, and that would throw the entire process into a state of chaos . 
Even so, it is exceedingly important that the American people get the truth about what is in these emails, and hopefully that will happen as rapidly as possible.

"title: Egyptian kangaroo court confirms 20-year-prison sentence on Morsi author: nan text: (7 fans) - Advertisement - Amid mounting anger against the US-client government of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi because of tax rises, soaring food prices, inflation and cuts in state subsidies, a kangaroo court in Cairo has confirmed a 20-year prison sentence against Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected President who was deposed by Al-Sisi in July 2013. 
In April 2015, a Cairo court had sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison for inciting violence against protesters who had staged a sit-in outside the Ittihadiya presidential palace in December 2012, when Morsi was still in power. 
Twenty-year jail sentences were also confirmed against other senior figures from Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, including Mohamed el-Beltagy and Essam el-Erian. The men were convicted in April 2015 on charges including kidnapping, torture and the killings of protesters during unrest in 2012. 
Morsi, elected in 2012 and overthrown in 2013, is facing several trials. After a controversial trial, he was sentenced to death in May 2015 for allegedly participating in violence against the police during the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak, but his court appointed lawyers have appealed that verdict. 
An Egyptian court cancelled the life sentences on Tuesday (Oct 25) handed out to former president Mohamed Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood chief Mohamed Badie along with 15 other leaders of the banned group in an espionage case and ordered a retrial. 
The court also cancelled death sentences handed out to 16 other Muslim Brotherhood members, including top leaders Khyrat el-Sharer and Mohamed el-Beltagy Ahmed Abdel Aty. Thirteen of the 16 were sentenced in absentia. The defendants were accused of spying, funding terrorism and disclosing national security. 
Turkey's president, Tayyip ErdoÄan, had criticized the death sentence for Morsi and accused the west of hypocrisy. ""The popularly elected president of Egypt, chosen with 52% of the vote, has unfortunately been sentenced to death,"" ErdoÄan said at a rally in Istanbul. 
""Egypt is turning back into ancient Egypt,"" he said, referring to the Pharaonic rule of the land that ended more than two millennia ago. ""The west, unfortunately, is still turning a blind eye to Sisi's coup,"" he added. ""While they abolished the death penalty in their own countries, they just look on as spectators at this execution in Egypt."" - Advertisement - 
Morsi, who has also been sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of leaking state secrets to Qatar, has not appointed a lawyer to defend himself and has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the court proceedings, saying he remains Egypt's legitimate president. 
The Muslim Brotherhood has been blamed for the unrest in Egypt, which has resulted in the death of hundreds of people. Al-Sisi's government designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by imprisonment. 
Hundreds of people have been sentenced to death in a crackdown following Morsi's overthrow. Seven have been executed, including six defendants sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly participating in militant attacks. 
More than three years after Sisi ousted Morsi, his promise to restore stability is wearing thin. Desperation and anger among Egyptians is mounting due to increase in food prices, while the double-digit inflation rate squeezes poor Egyptians. 
According to the Middle East Monitor, core inflation is at seven-year-highs, near 14 percent, as a foreign exchange shortage and a hike in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars. The government raised electricity prices by 25-40 percent in August and is phasing in a 13 percent value-added tax approved by parliament in the same month. - Advertisement - 
As part of reforms aimed at clinching a $12 billion IMF loan needed to plug its gaping budget deficit, the government is also expected to cut petrol subsidies and devalue the Egyptian pound, prompting a further cycle of inflation in Egypt, where tens of millions rely on state-subsidized bread, the Middle East Monitor said adding: ""Dollar rationing at banks has driven businesses toward the black market where the dollar is now selling for more than 15.5 pounds -- a huge mark-up from the official rate of about 8.8. Rumors have spread that Friday Nov. 11 will be a day of protest over economic conditions, the Middle East Monitor reported. Police have already detained about 70 people for inciting protests, accusing many of loyalty to the banned Muslim Brotherhood."
"title: Blame Government, Not Markets for Monopoly author: Ron Paul text: Email 
When Time-Warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. These concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both Time-Warner's competitors and consumers. 
No, I am not talking about Time-Warner’s recent announced plan to merge with AT&T, but the reaction to Time-Warner’s merger with (then) Internet giant AOL in 2000. Far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the AOL-Time-Warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
The failure of AOL-Time-Warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. AOL-Time-Warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices and/or better quality. 
Corporate mergers and “hostile” takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. These managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. Thus, laws making it difficult to launch a ""hostile"" takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
Monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. For example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. Similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a “franchise” agreement with their local government. Fortunately, the Internet has given Americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the ""mainstream"" media. This may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
Government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. Large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. Big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
Examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Another example is the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
Legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. This legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and Internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
Many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the Federal Reserve’s inflationary monetary policy. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the AOL-Time-Warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the Fed-created dot.com bubble. 
In a free market , mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. Any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices and/or higher quality. Monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. Therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. The most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the Federal Reserve .

"title: Anniversaries are becoming more frequent author: Guest text: November 15, 2016 
Sunday was the anniversary of the Bataclan attack, just recently was the 1,000th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings and the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster. Yet there is no record of anyone commemorating the first anniversary of the Battle of Hastings in 1067, nor the 100th anniversary in 1166. 
It has gradually crept up on us though. At first, only significant anniversaries were recognised, numbers like 25, 50 or 100; but gradually it has spread to any year ending in ‘0’ or can easily be fitted onto a badge. If we don’t stop the trend then before long every year will be an anniversary of something that happened before. 
Said one currency trader: ‘We can make £1 Billion in a second, so if we’re forced to remain silent for a minute you can see how this costs the economy’. He declined to explain his hypothesis further, saying that it was his birthday today and he was off to the pub for an extended lunch, but would be available for further comment after 4pm."
"title: Duterte Tells US Businesses to Quit Whining or GTFO author: Andrew Anglin text: In the name of the people. 
This is the only morality. 
Philippine Star : 
If his scathing and vulgar comments are causing consternation and worry among American investors and businessmen, President Duterte said yesterday they can always pack up and leave. 
Duterte was reacting to pronouncements from visiting US State Department Assistant Secretary Daniel Russel that his conflicting statements were causing jitters among US businessmen. 
âGo ahead. Pack your bags. We will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone through the worst of times in this planet,â the President said in a press briefing at the NAIA Terminal 2 shortly before his departure for Japan. 
Russel on Friday said Duterteâs recent statements â especially his âseparationâ from the US â have ushered in a âclimate of uncertainty.â 
âThe succession of controversial statements, comments and a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippinesâ intentions have created consternation in a number of countries,â Russel told reporters Monday after meeting Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in Manila. 
âNot only in mine and not only among governments, but also growing concern in other communities, in the expat Filipino community, in corporate boardrooms as well.â 
Duterte called the US official gago or stupid for asking him to tone down his anti-US rhetoric, saying it was Washington that started the rift between them. 
âI had a talk with Secretary Yasay and hereâs a guy his name is Russel, if you can just tone down our rhetoric. But I was not the one who started this rift. They are the ones who started it,â the President told reporters. 
He noted that during the campaign, Ambassador Philip Goldberg got his goat when the diplomat reacted to his joke about the rape-slay of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao City. 
âRemember, it all started during the election. I made a comment in narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. The ambassador said something not very nice,â he pointed out. 
âYou are not supposed to do that because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth,â he said, addressing Goldberg. 
KIKE Goldberg. 
In the final stretch of the campaign, Duterte joked about the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill during a prison riot. He said Hamill looked like an actress and as mayor âhe should have been first.â His remarks drew condemnation from several quarters, particularly womenâs groups. 
The rising death toll in the Duterte administrationâs war on drugs has sparked concerns among Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union. 
For Duterte, Russelâs statement was an insult. âI said donât do that to me. Every time they threaten us, including the EU (European Union), they think they are brighter than us,â Duterte said. 
âThen they will say âbe careful, we will put you in prison.â Son of a w***e. Go ahead.â 
Duterte maintained he would never be subservient to the interests of the US or any other foreign country. 
âYou know before we can move forward, Mr. America, there are things â so many things â the massacre of the Filipinos before. These are historical hurts that would never go away,â he said. He had earlier called the attention of the US to the massacre by its soldiers of hundreds of Muslims in the early 20th century. 
âI am not also a lapdog of any country. Only the Filipinos can treat me as a lapdog. Period. Nothing else. 
âDo not make us dogs. Do not. As if I am a dog with a leash and then you throw bread far away that I cannot reach.â 
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a âson of a b***hâ and told him to âgo to hell.â 
Duterte also hit Russel for supposedly being too nervous about his recent state visit to China. 
âNow, what did I tell to China? I went there, just being nice,â the President said. âI am just a small person. How can I cause distress? You are nervous because you are guilty.â 
Duterte said his state visit to China last week triggered a lot of speculations. 
âNapakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago (These fools were quick to think maliciously). We did not talk about anything in China except to cook siopao and chopsuey,â the President said in jest. 
Duterte also scored Goldbergâs statement that the US remains committed to defend the Philippines. 
âThere will be no wars anymore. Who will wage war with us? China? What will they get? Japan? What defense? They want to talk about the boogeyman war,â the President said. 
âStop that s**t. Nobody is interested in wars anymore. And if there is a fight, you fight your wars. Do not include mine.” 
Pure shitlordery. 
So great to see. 
And just for those who don’t get it: Duterte is not “anti-American,” he is anti-ZOGmerican. Filipinos have no problem with the American people, they have a problem with being slaves to international kike financial institutions and then, as already enslaved through massive debt programs and foreign ownership of infrastructure, being told by the Jew globalists that they’re not allowed to slaughter drug dealers because it’s mean. 
Duterte is doing what every leader should be doing by default: defending the people from enemies foreign and domestic. 
He is creating a new model of governance in the post-industrial era."
"title: Multi-Billionaire Hugo Salinas Price – ‘I Have Serious Doubts About The Survival Of Our Civilization’ author: King World News text: 8 Views November 08, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
As the world awaits the outcome of the election in the United States, some time ago multi-billionaire Hugo Salinas Price told King World News in stunning fashion what he believes to be the frightening plan to control the world going forward. He described the people planning this as “barbarians,” and said, “this is not going to end well.” He also issued this ominous warning, “I have very serious doubts about the survival of our civilization under such people.” Below is what the multi-billionaire had to say in this incredibly powerful interview. 
These People Are “Barbarians” Hugo Salinas Price: “With regards to the social question in the world, in 1929 a Spanish thinker by the name of Ortega y Gasset wrote a book that really shook up the world titled, ‘The Revolt of the Masses.’ He was talking about the appearance on the world stage of new individuals. 
He was writing about the growth of the population and the appearance of new individuals coming in to the mass of humanity. And these individuals evidently are (what he described as) ‘barbarians.’…. “They came too suddenly to be educated, and for the knowledge of how to keep the Western way of life alive. These (barbarian) people have increased (in numbers), and now they have taken over power (in the world).” 
We Are Now In The Hands Of These Barbarians So now we are in the hands of ‘barbarians.’ They have no idea of how our society came to be, and what is necessary to keep it going. They are fiddling with the controls: You might think of a monkey flying a 747 (airplane) — they don’t have any idea what they are doing. And this is not going to end well with the barbarians at the controls… IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Hugo Salinas Price continues: “ We don’t have people who write books in power any more. I remember when a Prime Minister of England was a skilled musician and wrote books before he became Prime Minister. Where do we have such people in power today? We don’t have scholars or people with a true background of education, history, economics and politics. 
“I Have Serious Doubts About The Survival Of Our Civilization” They are all working on the spur of the moment. They are experimenting to see if this works and that works. And I have very serious doubts about the survival of our civilization under such people. I expect that a great crisis is coming. We are going to see a great separation and some people are just not going to make it, and the old truths are going to come back into fashion because of the need for survival.” 
Hugo Salinas Price also added: “I think we are going to see a series of bankruptcies. I think the (eventual) rise in interest rates is the fatal sign which is going to ignite a derivatives crisis. This is going to bring down the derivatives system (and the financial system). 
“It’s Not Going To Be A Very Pleasant World” There are (over) one quadrillion dollars of derivatives and most of them are related to interest rates. The spiking of interest rates in the United States may set that off. What is going to happen in the world is eventually we are going to come to a moment where there is going to be massive bankruptcies around the globe. 
What is going to be left after the dust settles is gold, and some people are going to have it and some people are not. Then the problem is going to be to hold on to what you’ve got because it’s not going to be a very pleasant world.”

"title: Comment on Dilbert cartoonist & hypnotist Scott Adams in 2015 predicted a Hillary health crisis by Free the TrumpRolled! author: Free the TrumpRolled! text: Posted on September 13, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 19 Comments 
Scott Adams is creator of the Dilbert comic strip. According to his self-description, Adams is also a hypnotist of many years, trained in observing people and subtle nuances in appearance and body language. 
Below is Adams’ post of September 11, 2016, “ Checking My Predictions About Clinton’s Health ,” which was republished by Russia Insider : 
In a blog post I wrote on December 27th , 2015, I said this… 
Bonus Thought 1: One of the skills a hypnotist has to master is reading people’s inner thoughts based on their body language. That’s a common skill for people in the business world too, but hypnotists go deeper than looking at crossed arms and furrowed brows. We learn to look for subtle changes in breathing patterns, tiny changes in muscle tone, variations in skin color (blushing or not), word choice, pupil dilation, and more. I assume law enforcement people look for similar tells when doing interrogations. 
As regular readers know, I’m a trained hypnotist. And to me, Hillary Clinton looks as if she is hiding a major health issue. If you read Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Blink , you know that so-called “experts” can sometimes instantly make decisions before they know why . In my case, I am going to make an “expert” hypnotist prediction about Hillary Clinton without knowing exactly which clues I am picking up, or whether I am hallucinating them. 
Prediction: I’ll put the odds at 75% that we learn of an important Clinton health issue before the general election. That estimate is based on my own track record of guessing things about people without the benefit of knowing why . I think Trump is picking up the same vibe. He has already questioned Clinton’s “stamina.” 
On December 29th, 2015 I blogged that Trump would be seen as “running unopposed” before election day. I mentioned Clinton’s health as a possible reason. 
While I’m on the topic, I’ll add another prediction to the Master Persuader series. I predict that by the time Trump is in the general election and running against Clinton, you will start hearing that Trump ( Lucky Hitler) is – for all practical purposes – “running unopposed” as Clinton’s poll numbers plummet. 
That can happen in a variety of ways. One way is if Clinton’s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying, and Trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else. Once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term, or might be in jail, you start to imagine it as a one-person race. 
And you will. That’s how you get a landslide. 
Look for the words “running unopposed” in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day. And it still counts if it started here, because it won’t catch on unless it actually fits. 
On April 29th of 2016 I expanded on the thought in this post . 
I have blogged and tweeted that Hillary Clinton looks unhealthy to me. And I have mentioned on Twitter that one of the skills of a hypnotist is identifying subtle bodily changes. Observation is a huge part of a hypnotist’s skill. You look for micro changes in muscle tone, breathing, posture, and anything else that can tell you whether your technique is working or you need to quickly pivot to a new approach. Think of it as rapid A-B testing on humans. And like any skill, one gets better with practice. I have more than three decades of practice for this specific skill. 
What I see in Clinton’s health is an unusual level of variability. Sometimes her eyes bug out, sometimes they are tired and baggy. Sometimes she looks puffy, sometimes not. It would be easy to assume fatigue is the important variable. And that is clearly a big factor. But notice that the other candidates have little variability in their physicality. Trump always looks like Trump. Cruz always looks like Cruz, and so on. Sometimes we think we can detect fatigue in their answers, but visually the other candidates appear about the same every day. 
Clinton, on the other hand, looks   That suggests some greater variability in her health. And that’s probably a tell for medications that are waxing and waning but rarely at the ideal levels. Or perhaps the underlying conditions have normal variability. Or both. 
Under normal circumstances it would be deeply irresponsible for a cartoonist to give a medical diagnosis to a stranger he hasn’t met. I trust you to ignore my medical opinions. I do this to build a record of my persuasion-related predictions and to show you the method. 
I give Clinton a 50% chance of making it to November with sufficiently good health to be considered a viable president. Judging from her performance on the campaign trail, she is managing her health effectively to get the job done. But I would think most people who run for president end up sacrificing their health in some measure. The big question is how much buffer she has left. 
To be clear, there is no dependable evidence of Clinton having an undisclosed major health issue. But it looks that way to observers.

"title: Hacker Guccifer 2.0 Warns He Has “Info From Inside FEC: Democrats May Rig The Elections” author: Contributing Author text: 
Before the recent torrent of daily Podesta email dumps brought renewed attention to Wikileaks (and accusations Julian Assange was working with the Kremlin despite his recent denial, which ultimately cost him his internet access), the media’s attention was closely focused on the recently emerged hacker known as Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be behind the hacking of the nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails and other documents distributed over the summer by WikiLeaks, and who likewise was accused of cooperating with Russia.
Earlier today, after a two week silence, Guccifer 2.0 reemerged, with a post on his blog, in which he alleges that he has information from inside the Federal Election Commission, according to which “democrats may rig the elections.” He then adds “this may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.”
INFO FROM INSIDE THE FEC: THE DEMOCRATS MAY RIG THE ELECTIONS I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.
As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.
I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.
I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.
It is unclear what FEC information the hacker was in possession of, or was referring to, and how he intends to observe the elections. A recent video by Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting provided a real-time demo of the GEMS vote-fraud system, “fraction magic,” an election theft mechanism with context and explanation. There is much more detail on the BlackBoxVoting website .
The demonstration below used a real voting system and real vote databases and takes place in seconds across multiple jurisdictions. Over 5000 subcontractors and middlemen have the access to perform this for any or all clients. It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses. All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. It’s a product. It’s scaleable. It learns its environment and can adjust to any political environment, any demographic. It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing.
It is possible that this is the process that Guccifer is referring to, although we are merely speculating. We are confident he will provide more detail shortly.

"title: A Federal Judge Just Ordered The RNC To Reveal Its Voter Fraud Pact With Trump author: Grant Stern text: Comments 
Federal Judge John Michael Vazquez set a court appearance for this Thursday for the Democratic National Committee’s emergency legal action to fight Republican minority suppression efforts. 
The DNC filed suit over a generation-old consent decree last week seeking an injunction and extension of the order by eight years, which prevents illegal Republican voter suppression “ballot security” measures. 
That lawsuit is looking ever more likely to succeed, resulting in an order barring Republicans across the country from targeting minority voters. The RNC’s response pointedly omitted any defense of the Michigan and Pennsylvania RNC members accused of unlawful ballot security programs, who are the two key players in this courtroom drama that also involves VP candidate Mike Pence and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
The federal judge ordered both Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDonald – Mitt Romney’s niece – and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason to submit sworn statements along with documentation of their ballot security programs by 5pm today. 
Last night, Republican lawyers tossed the two high-ranking RNC members under the bus by failing entirely to defend their actions, sworn accounts of which are due at 5pm today. The Democrat’s strongest claims are against the two national RNC members who spoke to the media about ballot security programs. 
The Washington Post wrote about the Pennsylvania GOP’s plans to flood urban Philadelphia with suburban poll watchers from other counties and a legal effort to remove state law restrictions on out of county ballot watchers, while t he Michigan State GOP Chairwoman was quoted in The Detroit Free Press as saying she was directing measures in Michigan to launch a “massive anti-fraud” effort. 
Under the 1982 agreement between the parties as it’s been modified through the years, any “ballot security program” must be submitted to the court and DNC for “preclearance” ten days before being implemented. It seems highly unlikely that the DNC was notified of any of the four major activities the court demanded to be explained. 
The Republican National Committee also has until 5pm today to deliver statements about minority voter suppression made in public, video recorded comments by VP nominee Mike Pence and media reports about the Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s statements after the third and final debate. Additionally, the national Republican party has got to deliver to the court any and all agreements between the RNC and the Trump campaign that involve electioneering or polling places to the court as well. 
The Democratic lawyers even submitted fresh evidence to the court that the RNC is involved nationally in poll security operations, which a former federal prosecutor obtained via text message during the normal course of poll watching activities. The RNC denies activity in any and all poll watching venues in their legal filings. 
The Republican National Committee is clearly frustrated by its lengthy tenure under the key voter protection legal agreement, and you can tell from the legal filing that it wants out. However, the Republican party of Trump isn’t playing by the rules, like it’s standard bearer doesn’t play by the rules, and now they’re likely going to be punished. 
Tonight, the music stops and the Republicans will finally have to answer for their dirty campaign tactics, or face the wrath of a federal judge. 
Here’s the judge’s complete order:"

"title: BREAKING: Clinton’s intelligence briefings suspended indefinitely following latest in email scandal | Christian Times Newspaper author: nan text: 0 SHARE 
Law enforcement and national intelligence officials have suspended Hillary Clinton’s weekly intelligence briefings after further information regarding the Democratic nominee’s use of private emails has surfaced. 
According to sources familiar with the briefing process, senior officials notified the Clinton campaign on Sunday afternoon that several federal agencies “no longer believed it was either appropriate or prudent for a candidate to receive classified intelligence briefings while under a significant and ongoing investigation.” 
“While the FBI and Department of Justice continue their independent investigations and while the law enforcement community continues to search for answers, it would be unwise to continue national security briefings amidst a very serious investigation concerning threats to national security.” 
It is customary for the major party nominees to receive weekly classified intelligence briefings from senior defense and intelligence officials in order for the eventual president to be fully knowledgeable on matters of national security. Both Clinton and Donald Trump have received these briefings since their respective party conventions in June. 
On Friday, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, notified Congress that the Bureau was effectively reopening its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Comey wrote that new emails had surfaced that led investigators to warrant further examination. 
According to sources familiar with the investigation the newly-found emails were found on a device of Clinton’s personal aide Huma Abedin. Abedin is married to disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener, and it is believed that the emails were discovered during an ongoing investigation into his sexting scandal. 
This latest revelation, including the suspension of weekly intelligence briefings, does not bode well for the former Secretary of State in the final days of a heated election. Donald Trump has seized on the news, and he is expected to continue to do so in the coming week.”

"title: Why Witches, Occultists And Satanists Celebrate Halloween, And Why You Should Not author: The Doc text: Why Witches, Occultists And Satanists Celebrate Halloween, And Why You Should Not Posted on Tweet Home » Headlines » World News » Why Witches, Occultists And Satanists Celebrate Halloween, And Why You Should Not 
Halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches, occultists and Satanists. All over America, those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead, casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices. On October 31st, most people will simply ignore the dark side of Halloween. We can assure you however, that the Creator does NOT… 

From Michael Snyder, End of the American Dream : 
The vast majority of the population will dress up in costumes, go to parties and eat candy without ever even considering where the holiday came from or what certain people are doing behind closed doors. But the truth is that Halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches, occultists and Satanists. All over America, those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead, casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices. As you will see below, there is a reason why animal shelters across the country ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year. But even our “innocent” Halloween traditions such as dressing up in costumes, “trick or treating” and carving jack-o’-lanterns all have their roots in ancient pagan practices. And every year the costumes for our young girls become even more sexually suggestive, the horror movies become even more demonic, and the public’s fascination with the occult just continues to grow. It truly is a festival of death, but most people don’t seem to care. In fact, experts are telling us that Halloween has now become America’s second biggest holiday. 
According to the National Retail Federation, nearly 70 percent of all Americans plan to celebrate Halloween this year, and spending is expected to shatter the all-time record… 
According to the National Retail Federation’s annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, total spending for Halloween is expected to reach $8.4 billion, an all-time high in the survey’s 11-year history. 
U.S. consumers are expected to spend an average of $82.93, up from last year’s $74.34, with more than 171 million Americans planning to partake in Halloween festivities this year. 
To give you some context, total Halloween spending for 2009 came in at just 4.7 billion dollars. So to say that the celebration of Halloween is growing would be a tremendous understatement. 
Sadly, most people have no idea where this holiday originally came from. The truth is that a long time ago Catholicism attempted to “Christianize” an ancient pagan holiday known as Samhain… 
The origins of Halloween are Celtic in tradition and have to do with observing the end of summer sacrifices to gods in Druidic tradition. In what is now Britain and France, it was the beginning of the Celtic year, and they believed Samhain, the lord of death, sent evil spirits abroad to attack humans, who could escape only by assuming disguises and looking like evil spirits themselves. The waning of the sun and the approach of dark winter made the evil spirits rejoice and play nasty tricks. Believe it or not, most of our Halloween practices can be traced back to these old pagan rites and superstitions . 
On the Wiccan calendar, Samhain is one of the most important points on “the wheel of the year”. Wiccans believe that it is the day when “the god dies”, and subsequently they celebrate his rebirth at Yule. 
It is also a time when they believe that the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest, and so it is an opportune time for them to contact the dead. The following is much more on what Wiccans believe about Samhain from wicca.com… 
Samhain, (pronounced SOW-in, SAH-vin, or SAM-hayne) means “End of Summer”, and is the third and final Harvest. The dark winter half of the year commences on this Sabbat. 
It is generally celebrated on October 31st, but some traditions prefer November 1st. It is one of the two “spirit-nights” each year, the other being Beltane. It is a magical interval when the mundane laws of time and space are temporarily suspended, and the Thin Veil between the worlds is lifted. Communicating with ancestors and departed loved ones is easy at this time, for they journey through this world on their way to the Summerlands. It is a time to study the Dark Mysteries and honor the Dark Mother and the Dark Father, symbolized by the Crone and her aged Consort. 
Originally the “Feast of the Dead” was celebrated in Celtic countries by leaving food offerings on altars and doorsteps for the “wandering dead”. Today a lot of practitioners still carry out that tradition. Single candles were lit and left in a window to help guide the spirits of ancestors and loved ones home. Extra chairs were set to the table and around the hearth for the unseen guest. Apples were buried along roadsides and paths for spirits who were lost or had no descendants to provide for them. Turnips were hollowed out and carved to look like protective spirits, for this was a night of magic and chaos. The Wee Folke became very active, pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. Traveling after dark was was not advised. People dressed in white (like ghosts), wore disguises made of straw, or dressed as the opposite gender in order to fool the Nature spirits. 
The ancient practices described in those paragraphs sound very similar to what we do today in many ways, but without a doubt some of the traditions have evolved. For example, instead of carving turnips, those that celebrate Halloween carve pumpkins today. 
You may not realize this, but Wicca is actually one of the fastest growing religions in America. And on October 31st, Wiccans all over the nation will get together to conduct rituals and cast spells. Here is a blurb from Wikipedia about the Wiccan belief in “magic”… 
During ritual practices, which are often staged in a sacred circle, Wiccans cast spells or “workings” intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences. [63] Many early Wiccans, such asAlex Sanders, Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield, referred to their own magic as “white magic“, which contrasted with “black magic“, which they associated with evil and Satanism. Sanders also used the similar terminology of “left hand path” to describe malevolent magic, and “right hand path” to describe magic performed with good intentions; [64] terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil. [65] 
If you are not familiar with these things, you may scoff at such practices. But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that they are very real. The dark side has power too, and those that have come out of witchcraft can tell you some stories that will stand your hair on end. 
Wiccans think of themselves as “good”, and so they tend to reject blood sacrifices and things of that nature. 
But for those that are deeper into the occult, blood sacrifice is an essential part of Halloween. As I mentioned above, many animal shelters all over the nation ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year… It’s the week of Halloween, and maybe you don’t know this, but if you suddenly wanted to adopt a black cat, you would probably have a hard time. That’s because thanks to their association with witchcraft, accepted wisdom holds that Halloween is a time when people ritualistically mutilate black cats. 
To test if this really was still accepted wisdom, I contacted some animal shelters near to our Los Angeles office, and they all told me they wouldn’t let me adopt a black cat. One, The Lange Foundation—the type of animal rescue that takes in cats from city shelters before they can be euthanized—was willing to talk to me on the phone and explain: If someone were to call and ask specifically for a black cat, that would trigger the policy. “I would say ‘not today!’” said one of the foundation’s board members, Diana Nelson. 
You may not want to believe it, but animals will be killed and little children will be abused on Halloween night. The following is what one ex-witch has sharedregarding her experiences… 
My parents told me before we went around the neighborhood we were going to go by the church (Mormon Church) to get some candy there. The church was very close to my grandmother’s house, and I knew so from going often. 
We went to the church and what happened next made my blood curdle. I was given candy, but that was just a preclude to the sexual abuse that would happen in a satanic ritual. On Halloween Satanists use young children, such as myself, as sexual idols to worship. Other children receive a far worse fate. Death. I know for some this is more than you can even think to believe, but it is true. I can barely write these words because the pain of the truth is almost more than I can bear. If it wasn’t for the grace and love of Jesus Christ, I would not even be here writing this at all. 
You may say “it doesn’t mean that to me”, but you are just fooling yourself. 
Could you take a Satanic Black Mass and turn it into a celebration of Jesus? 
Of course not. 
And yet so many Christians fully embrace Halloween and pretend that there is nothing wrong with it. 
For the record, Satanists absolutely love Halloween. The following comes from the official Church of Satan website… 
Satanists embrace what this holiday has become, and do not feel the need to be tied to ancient practices. This night, we smile at the amateur explorers of their own inner darkness, for we know that they enjoy their brief dip into the pool of the “shadow world.” We encourage their tenebrous fantasies, the candied indulgence, and the wide-ranging evocation of our aesthetics (while tolerating some of the chintzy versions), even if it is but once a year. For the rest of the time, when those not of our meta-tribe shake their heads in wonder at us, we can point out that they may find some understanding by examining their own All Hallows Eve doings, but we generally find it simpler to just say: “Think of the Addams Family and you’ll begin to see what we’re about.” 
Satanists consider Halloween to be one of the most important “holidays” of the year. On page 96 of the Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey wrote the following… 
“After one’s own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht (May 1st) and Halloween.” 
Isn’t that lovely? 
Despite all of this, most Christians in America will happily celebrate Halloween on October 31st. In fact, one recent survey found that just 8 percent of all Christian pastors want their congregations to skip the holiday altogether. Instead, most of them want their members to invite people to a “Christian version of Halloween” at their churches. The following comes from Charisma… 
Two-thirds (67 percent) encourage church members to invite friends and neighbors to a fall festival, trunk-or-treat or judgment house. Pastors at bigger churches (those with 250 or more in attendance) are most likely to ask church members to invite their neighbors (86 percent) to an event at the church. Those from small churches (50 or less in attendance) are least likely (48 percent). 
If the gospel is preached, I am all for people going to church on October 31st. But all too often these “alternative celebrations” are nothing more than repackaged versions of the same Satanic holiday that the world is celebrating. I like how Pastor Jamie Morgan described what our approach to this day should be… 
Setting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, “Happy Birthday, Jesus!” The two just don’t go together. Jesus has nothing in common with Satan (2 Cor. 6:14), and neither should we. 
And the truth is that God has wanted us to have nothing to do with occult practices from the very beginning. The following is what Deuteronomy 18:9-13 says in the Modern English version… 
9 When you enter into the land which the Lord your God gives you, you must not learn to practice the abominations of those nations . 10 There must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or who uses divination , or uses witchcraft , or an interpreter of omens, or a sorcerer , 11 or one who casts spells , or a spiritualist , or an occultist , or a necromancer . 12 For all that do these things are an abomination to the Lord , and because of these abominations the Lord your God will drive them out from before you. 13 You must be blameless before the Lord your God. 
There will be many people that will read this article and will continue to celebrate Halloween just as they normally do. If that is you, then you need to understand that engaging in dark practices can open up doors to spiritual darkness for yourself and your entire family. 
If you do that, then that is your choice, but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord."

Donald Trump once again confounded his critics with an unexpected victory in the U.S. presidential election. Will he now seek to turn U.S.-Russian relations upside down? Donald Trump once again confounded his critics with an unexpected victory in the U.S. presidential election. Will he now seek to turn U.S.-Russian relations upside down?

Donald Trump completed one of the great upsets in American political history when he vaulted above the 270 Electoral College vote minimum needed to become president. His presidency, which begins Jan. 20, 2017, offers interesting possibilities for U.S.-Russian relations .
Trump’s affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin has been well documented, and Putin’s sentiments about Trump are equally positive. On Nov. 9, Putin was among the first of the world’s leaders to offer his congratulations to Trump. But will a gesture of goodwill lead to substantive change in the U.S.-Russian partnership? Trump has intriguing possibilities to weigh.
Doing away with the sanctions President Barack Obama handed down in response to Russia’s involvement in 2014 in Ukraine is one. Last year, Russian officials estimated the sanctions cost the country more than $100 billion. It is safe to assume that figure has grown this year, and sagging oil prices have added a second significant strain to the Russian budget.
Demanding that NATO nations pay for more of the costs associated with the organization would be a second option Trump could employ. Within hours of Trump’s victory, NATO’s secretary general urged him to not forget the longstanding relationship between the U.S. and Western Europe in maintaining peace. Trump could add further stress to the relationship – to Russia’s advantage – if he limited the role of the U.S. military in the region.
Read the Q&amp;A with Dmitri Trenin: "" Trump's presidency and the future of US-Russia relations "" Staying out of the way as Russia continued its aerial assault on Syria’s rebels would be another way of demonstrating that a President Trump would deal with Russia in sharply different ways than Obama.
There is no way to know right now if Trump will follow through on any of these ideas once he assumes office.
He also has so-called soft power options at his disposal to change the way Russia views America. For example, he could urge the U.S. Congress to restore funding for Title VIII , a program that allows U.S. scholars to engage in research about Russia and gain Russian language proficiency. Funding levels were cut three years ago. Along the same lines, he could push for increased academic, athletic and cultural exchanges between the two nations.
President Obama’s famous “reset” button that Hillary Clinton carried to Moscow during her first visit as U.S. Secretary of State proved ineffective, and her critics jumped on it during the recent presidential campaign to show how incompetent she would be on the world stage. Trump is not likely to use any prop to show his intentions of improving Washington’s relationship with Moscow.
But the substantive options he does choose will determine just how much he intends to break with his soon-to-be predecessor’s plans. Western European leaders, perhaps more than any other, will be watching closely.

"title: British PM Refuses To Withdraw Support For Saudi Arabia author: Carol Adl text: Posted on October 27, 2016 by Carol Adl in News // 0 Comments 
The British Prime Minister has refused to withdraw her support for UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
Theresa May also refused to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s place on the UN Human Rights Council despite the Kingdoms atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confronted May over Saudi violations and called for an end to the weapons sales (see video below) 
Press TV reports: 
“The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,” May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month. 
London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. 
Rights groups have also condemned the Kingdom’s crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists."

Accuracy in Media 
In one of her secret speeches, Hillary Clinton said, “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders…” Before this comment was revealed, Adam Taylor of The Washington Post tried to assure everyone that the idea of a North American Union, like the meddlesome and bureaucratic European Union, was dead. Such talk, he said, emanated from “fringe websites” and “conspiracy theorists.” 
The Hillary speech was made to a Brazilian bank known as Itaú BBA, which describes itself as “Latin America’s largest Corporate & Investment Bank” and part of the Itaú Unibanco group, “one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates.” 
The problem for Taylor and other faux journalists is that there is a whole body of research on the topic of a “ North American Law Project ,” designed to integrate the legal systems of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The project is run out of American University’s Center for North American Studies, where students can concentrate in North American Studies . As a matter of fact, such degrees are being offered by several different colleges and universities, including Canada’s McGill University . 
Passed in 1993, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, began the process of harmonizing laws among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Council on Foreign Relations admits that the U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. This has led to a loss of about 600,000 jobs. 
In addition to shipping jobs to Mexico, NAFTA constituted subversion of our constitutional system. President Clinton submitted NAFTA as an agreement, requiring only a majority of votes in both Houses of Congress for passage, and not a treaty, which would have required a two-thirds vote in favor in the Senate. NAFTA passed by votes of 234-200 in the House and 61-38 in the Senate. 
A money crash soon followed in 1995 as Mexico was hit by a peso crisis, and a U.S. bailout was arranged. Congress would not bail out Mexico, so Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $40 billion through the International Monetary Fund and the “Exchange Stabilization Fund.” 
Meanwhile, pressure has been building for the creation of a “North American Community”—also known as a “North American Union”—with regular meetings involving the leaders of the three countries. On June 29, 2016, the Obama White House issued a fact sheet on this year’s “North American Leaders’ Summit.” It said, “The economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually.” 
The leaders of these countries agreed to establish a “North American Caucus” to “more effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.” One item on the agenda was for the leaders to reaffirm “North America’s strong support for [Colombian] President Santos’s efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas.” That fell apart on October 2 when a “peace deal” with the communist terrorists was voted down by the people of Colombia. 
But notice how these leaders claim to speak for “North America.” 
Going global, they also declared, “North America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.” 
This is U.N.-speak for global taxes and other forms of foreign aid from the U.S. to the rest of the world. 
We noted in a column last year that the American people, through their elected representatives, have had absolutely no input in developing the new global agenda that President Obama has tried to implement without the input or approval of Congress. 
Interestingly, one of those deeply involved in this global agenda, as we noted at the time, was John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign who previously served as counselor to Obama. Podesta’s emails are at the center of the WikiLeaks disclosures about the operations of the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. 
Podesta, founder of the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and a member of the elitist Trilateral Commission , went to work for Obama as a senior policy consultant on climate change. A liberal Catholic, he has been a professor at Georgetown Law School. One of the leaked emails shows Podesta saying that he applauds the work of Pope Francis on climate change and that “all my Jesuit friends say the Pope is the real deal.” 
Podesta was picked by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be a member of the “high-level panel” of “eminent persons” planning the future of the globe. This so-called “High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda” released an 81-page report titled, “A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development.” 
“In simplest terms,” explains Patrick Wood, author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation , “Sustainable Development is a replacement economic system for capitalism and free enterprise. It is a system based on resource allocation and usage rather than on supply and demand and free economic market forces.” 
In this context, Wood argues that the major significance of the transfer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is not the immediate need by the U.N. or some countries to censor websites, but to generate revenue for global purposes. ICANN will do this, he argues, through management of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the links between the Internet and networks, electronic devices and embedded technology with IP addresses. “IoT are the connections between inanimate objects and the humans that depend upon them,” he notes. To accomplish this, ICANN has devised a new IP numbering system called IPV6, described as the “ vital expansion ” of the Internet. 
“In terms of ‘follow the money,’ IoT is expected to generate upwards of $3 trillion by 2025 and is growing at a rate of at least 30 percent per year,” Wood argues . “In other words, it is a huge market and money is flying everywhere. If the UN can figure out a way to tax this market, and they will, it will provide a windfall of income and perhaps enough to make it self-perpetuating.” 
He adds, “Congress never understood this when they passively let Obama fail to renew our contract with ICANN. However, Obama and his globalist handlers understood it perfectly well, which makes the deception and treachery of it even worse.” 
Under the cover of “sustainable development,” Wood predicts the Internet will be used to construct a massive database on human activities, in order to monitor and control nations’ and peoples’ access to resources. It will constitute ultimate socialist control and a form of “digital slavery,” from which he warns there may be no return. Cliff Kincaid

No wonder politics has become the art of bickering; the art of discord; the art of grasping at reefs, while we are drowning in perilous waters. No wonder, politics in the United States and much around the world has become polarized between two factions that fight for supremacy to the death. Not the death of the political class, but to the psychological and physical death of millions of people--in this country, the richest of the countries, the last best hope for mankind. Let alone the millions overseas. No wonder both the right and the left are focused on this set of policies: ""Deny them their rights; take their dignity away; give them a warm soup in a cold winter night; and go to sleep in peace."" What to say of this debasement of charity? What to say of this debasement of high morality? What to say of this debasement of politics? And there I was the other night, hearing and seeing the following words written on the screen of CNN, in their documentary on Hillary Clinton: - Advertisement - ""Politics is not the art of the possible"" politics is the art of making the impossible"" possible."" These are the words, not of Hillary of today or yesterday. These are the words of a young woman who breaks with tradition at the stodgy prestigious Wellesley College and becomes the first valedictorian in the history of that college. This is Hillary who is called to lead her class, not via invitation by academicians or administrators at Wellesley, but by her classmates who recognized the force of her leadership. This is Hillary Rodham, later to become Clinton, who throws away her prepared speech and delivers her oration extemporaneously: ""Politics is not the art of the possible"" politics is the art of making the impossible"" possible."" This is Hillary who is immediately recognized in the national press as a force of nature: woman's nature. This is a woman who could have been researching and writing and talking about political science for a lifetime. - Advertisement - This is a woman who could have climbed the rungs of academia with grace and ease. Instead"" She preferred to practice what she had discovered at such a young age. She rolled up her sleeves and went to work to make it possible for children to have a better life than the one to which they were clearly doomed by a society in thrall of control and scarcity and fear ."
"title: The Geometry of Energy and Meditation of Buddha author: nan text: License DMCA 
A mandala is a visual symbol often utilized in meditation practices and teachings. The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. 
A mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. 
The terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. 
Tantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. 
There is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. 
More broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - 
Essentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. 
Tantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. 
There is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. 
No matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. 
Seed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - 
One of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. 
This meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. 
To begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. 
The meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners."

Un Leo Messi deslumbrante, prodigioso, quimérico, enajenado, mirífico, sobrehumano, preternatural, mágico y defraudador de Hacienda llevó a su equipo lideradamente a la victoria. Su tanto y el tanto de Luis Suárez dieron, por tanto, la vuelta al tanto de Vitolo, lo que les permite seguir a dos puntos del albino líder de la clasificación. Real Madrid 3-0 Leganés 
Con Ronaldo desaparecido fue el galésico Bale quien se echó el equipo a la espalda. Con sus diez compañeros subidos a caballito encima de él, el galileico fue capaz de hacer dos goles. Morata, desde la chepa del galileo, cerró el marcador ante un Leganés impotente que acabó pidiendo la Viagra. Villarreal 2-0 Real Betis 
Los astados llegaron al Madrigal, plaza difícil, con casta y empuje. Faenas de estética hueca pero efectiva de Trigueros (una oreja) y Roberto Soriano (oreja y vuelta al ruedo). Celta 2-1 Valencia 
Se adelantó el Valencia gracias a un penalti. Parejo fue el encargado en transformar la pena máxima en gol, lo que dejó caras de sorpresa en los celtipetas, que empezaron a llamar a Parejo “El Druida” o “El hombre que transforma cosas en gol” y a tratarlo como una especie de semidiós de la cultura galaica. Superaron el estupor con dos goles que finalmente permitieron a los celtiñas llevarse la victoria y el corazón aún palpitante de Parejo. Espanyol 0-0 Athletic 
Espanyol y Athletic terminaron firmando el armisticio en el campo de Cornellá tras un partido muy disputado: sorprendieron los vascos al situar el regimiento de Húsares cerca de la portería rival. Los cañones españolistas no tardaron en responder con varias andanadas pero sin dejar grandes ocasiones claras. Ya en la segunda mitad, la infantería de los partidarios de Isabel II y la Reina Regente pusieron en serios aprietos a las tropas Carlistas, pero sin obtener el resultado esperado. A destacar la actuación de Espartero. Las Palmas 1-0 Eibar 
Jonathan Viera logró el tanto de la victoria para Las Palmas al límite del tiempo aunque en realidad fue en el minuto 94 de partido porque el último minuto fue el 90 y ahí no había marcado gol, con lo que en propiedad estaba fuera del tiempo pero, si nos abstraemos de términos físicos, podemos llegar a la conclusión de que nuestra forma de considerar el tiempo está ligada al modo en el que pensamos porque, al fin y al cabo, nosotros no vemos realmente el paso del tiempo sino que, simplemente, sufrimos una serie de experiencias distintas de las que tenemos almacenadas en nuestros recuerdos y es esta diferencia lo que nuestra mente consciente percibe como tiempo. Importante victoria de los palmípedos. Osasuna 0-1 Alavés 
Lucha de santos en el Sadar: por un lado, el nuevo fichaje del Alavés, Christian Santos, y por otro el delantero pamplonica, San Fermín. Mayor fortuna tuvo el alavita que marcó un gol con el aura, tanto que daba la vitoria a los de Victoria. Real Sociedad 2-0 Atlético de Madrid 
El Atlético de Madrid llegó a Anoeta con más ilusión que otra cosa; ilusión que se vio desbordada por la dura realidad (dos penaltis). La actitud de los realistas fue demasiado para los de Simeone, que se encontraron con un realismo sucio, complejo, enfangante, que les dejó postrados en un estado de total impotencia. Granada 1-1 Deportivo 
“Todo va bien, la vida te sonríe, crees que nada puede hacerte daño… hasta que el inútil de tu portero se mete un gol en propia meta. Oh, hados… oh, Fortuna… oh, portero”. (Gaizca Garitano, entrenador del Deportivo). Málaga 3-2 Sporting 
Lo más destacado del encuentro fue descubrir que en el equipo asturiano juega un señor que se apellida Cop. Cop significa “policía” en inglés -de ahí la película Robocop (Robot Policía o Polirobot, porque en realidad “cop” se traduciría más bien como “poli”)- pero Cop, el jugador, es de nacionalidad croata y a estas horas la redacción de El Mundo Today aún no ha logrado averiguar qué significa “Cop” en dicha lengua, aunque sí se sabe que, en catalán, “cop” significa golpe.

"title: BREAKING: TRUMP MOVES TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON! author: admin text: BREAKING: TRUMP MOVES TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON! Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign over a year ago, the media barely batted an eye. They all believed he was only trying to boost his business. 
As time went on, he began to win debate after debate and state after state as he received the most votes in Republican primary history while battling sixteen other candidates. The liberal media and Clinton campaign quickly went from thinking he was a joke to fearing him. 
As Trump began to take this country by storm, the media and Clintons tried everything in their power to destroy him. They tried desperately to accuse Donald Trump of inciting violence at his rallies. 
Thanks to videos released by Project Veritas , we now have concrete proof that it was Hillary Clinton that paid operatives to storm Trump rallies and incite violence. 
Hillary Clinton did not just pay mercenaries to assault Trump supporters, she also violated the law on several occasions. 
Robert Creamer, a Clinton crony, was one of the organizers of the paid violence and has also visited Obama at the White House at least 230 times. He was forced to resign from his position immediately following the release of these videos. 
Not only is he a top Hillary ally, but he kept her informed. She knew about these attacks and she ordered them to take place so that Donald Trump looked like he was inciting violence and fueling hate. 
Trump was forced to cancel his rally in Chicago due to the extreme violence by operatives working for Hillary Clinton. 
We are being told that Donald Trump is going to press charges on these people, including Hillary Clinton, under the Felony Mob Act. 
In Illinois, Trump will be citing the Illinois criminal statute. The Mob action is a Class Four felony punishable by 3-6 years in prison and a $25,000 fine for each charge in Illinois. When Trump brings forward the paperwork, he very well could charge anyone associated with helping, planning, organizing, or paying anyone to commit acts of violence–which would include Hillary Clinton. 
In Illinois, statute reads as follows: 
A person commits mob action when he or she engages in any of the following: The knowing or reckless use of force or violence disturbing the public peace by 2 or more persons acting together and without authority of law; The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons with the intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony or misdemeanor; or The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons, without authority of law, for the purpose of doing violence to the person or property of anyone supposed to have been guilty of a violation of the law, or for the purpose of exercising correctional powers or regulative

"title: 3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold author: Chris Black text: Chris Black November 9, 2016 3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold 
I think it was Hippocrates who said something along these lines: “let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food”. 
Today’s article is about trying to find a cure for the common cold or, more precisely, reviving ancient remedies from medieval Europe. 
And speaking of cures for cold, there’s another saying in my neck of the woods: if you take cold medicine, you’ll get better in seven days, otherwise you’ll be sick for a week. 
Do you see where this is going? 
Let me tell you another interesting little story: despite the fact that there are only a small number of basic ingredients to be found in OTC (over the counter) cold-medicine—around ten, give or take (ephedrine, ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, pseudo-ephedrine etc.)—the number of cold-related drugs in your pharmacy is in the hundreds. 
Each major pharmaceutical company that has a hand in the cold industry typically has at least 10 different types. Many have 20 or 30 or even more. 
That’s pretty confusing, especially when you’re knocked out by a bad case of flu or cold , you can’t think straight, and you just want something to get you out of your misery. You’ll gladly spend a bunch of money to feel better. 
Little do you know you’re wasting it on pure crap. Do you think I am exaggerating? 
Basically, in the cold medicine racket, the name of the game is making money via marketing and brainwashing. Have you noticed the huge number of drug-ads on TV? 70% of the money a television is making outside an election is from Big Pharma, so let that sink in really well. 
I am writing this article because last week I suffered from a bad case of cold, which rendered me pretty much useless until I started making and drinking an old cold/cough remedy that I learned from my grandmother. 
Onion tea 
It worked from day one, put me back on my feet, allowed me to think straight, to breathe and to write; you know what I mean. 
And then I realized that for us preppers, knowing ancient remedies for a disease that is wreaking havoc this time of the year would make for an interesting article. So, if you’re into staying healthy without taking drugs, keep reading. 
Let me tell you how it all began: awake at 4 AM. Can’t think, can’t write, can’t breathe, stuffy nose , sore throat. Does it sound familiar? 
Well, I managed to crawl to my car and hit a local pharmacy. I bought some stuff pompously titled “cold medicine”, got home, medicated myself, hit the bed, and woke up 3 hours later still feeling horrible. 
Then, it hit me: my grandmother used to make onion tea when I was little and I had a bad case of cold. I remember it smelled awful and tasted like rotten pig guts, but if I was a good boy and drank a lot of it, it worked. 
With these things in mind, I went to the kitchen, gathered 3 onions, washed’em up pretty good, and put them in the kettle to boil. 
The idea is to take 2-3 small onions and boil them slowly in a full kettle until the water is reduced by half via evaporation, then drink the tea as hot as you can stand it . 
Trust me folks, it really works: sore throat-gone, stuffy nose-gone, I was alive again. It does taste hideous, unless you’re a die-hard onion lover, but it’s a small cost to pay. 
Basically, with this magic potion you’ll be able to function, to be active: to be alive, so to speak, from day 1. 
You must drink two 3/4 cups of tea per day, essentially one in the morning and one before bed, that’s important. 
If you manage to squeeze 3 more in during the day, it will work like a Swiss watch. 
If all you have in the house are big-fat onions, you’ll just have to cut them in half before boiling it, but remember: don’t remove the peel. That’s essential; just wash the onion thoroughly. 
How does onion tea work? I really don’t know. There aren’t any “official” studies that I know of, probably because you can’t patent onions and sell them for 5 bucks a pop. It just does, provided you drink it hot as hell and you follow the recipe above. 
Vitamin C 
Besides onion tea, supplementing with vitamin C and D3 is also very important when it comes to mitigating colds and flu (these vitamins play an essential role in immunity overall), but it’s important to take big doses. The RDA is a joke. 
For example, I am talking about 2-3 grams of vitamin C per day, together with eating lots of fruit: oranges, grapefruits, lemons, kiwis, apples and, again very important, raw onions and garlic (natural antibiotics). 
The RDA is the minimal amount of Vitamin C (or whatever) to be taken daily in order to avoid getting scurvy (speaking of vitamin C). To be healthy, it takes for much more than that; remember that. 
Tomato Tea 
Another way of naturally treating a stuffy nose/nasal congestion is tomato tea. 
The recipe is: 1 cup of tomato juice , (but I’d use 2-3 tomatoes cut in half instead of tomato juice) a teaspoon of fresh garlic (basically a clove) half a teaspoon of chili sauce (I’d use a small red hot chilli pepper instead) one teaspoon of lemon juice (again, I’d use a whole fruit instead). 
Add a pinch of salt into the mix and heat them together in the kettle until they start boiling, then drink the tea as hot as you can take it. 
During the day, you can drink a mix of green tea and ginger tea with honey, as these ingredients boost the immune system and they break up phlegm naturally (the drugs are called expectorants). 
Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is a common occurrence when it comes to seasonal colds and flu, and besides my aforementioned magic onion tea recipe, you should try 2 additional tricks if you want to get better ASAP: first, gargle with apple cider vinegar after you dilute it in a glass of warm water (1-3 teaspoons of vinegar in 8 oz of water). 
Second, gargle with salt-water and if you’re hardcore, you can try rubbing your infected tonsils with salt (using your finger that is). It’s not a pleasant experience, but it works amazingly well. You can boost the recipe’s effectiveness by adding powdered cayenne pepper into the mix. 
Add one teaspoon of cayenne pepper plus one teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz. glass, and mix well together, obviously. Gargle vigorously with this formula until you get better. It will definitely break up the bacteria coating in your throat so expect to spit profusely for a couple of minutes afterwards. 
It’s very important to use high-quality, organic salt; not refined/processed stuff. I would recommend Himalayan salt (the pink variety), or salt-mine salt (the one that looks dirty). Processed, refined, snow white salt doesn’t work too great as it’s stripped of its essential trace elements. 
I hope the article helped and I can’t wait to see your comments in the dedicated sections below, AFTER trying my onion tea, obviously.

"title: Comment on After Fighting for Freedom, 76-yo Vet Sentenced to Die In Prison for Treating His Illness With Pot by Chris Wilson author: Chris Wilson text: Home / Health / Medical Marijuana / After Fighting for Freedom, 76-yo Vet Sentenced to Die In Prison for Treating His Illness With Pot After Fighting for Freedom, 76-yo Vet Sentenced to Die In Prison for Treating His Illness With Pot Claire Bernish April 21, 2016 17 Comments 
As public frustration helps sound the death knell for the drug war, its arbitrary laws and policies appear even more absurd. In the latest inexcusable enforcement of an antiquated law, 76-year-old disabled veteran Lee Carroll Brooker will live out what should be his golden years behind bars — for simple possession of cannabis. 
Brooker had been treating multiple chronic conditions with cannabis he grew in his son’s backyard; but when officials in Alabama officials discovered the three dozen plants, they threw him in prison for life — without the possibility of parole. 
Thanks to a pointless mandatory minimum sentencing catchall — and the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear his case this week — Brooker has been left little recourse but to ultimately die in jail for treating his ailments with a plant. 
“Alabama, like three other states, mandates a life without parole sentence for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana by people with certain prior felony convictions — and Mr. Brooker had been convicted of a string of robberies twenty years earlier in Florida, crimes for which he served ten years in prison,” The New York Times explained . “In such a case, the law doesn’t require prosecutors to prove any intent to sell the drug.” 
Essentially, Brooker has been imprisoned twice for the same crime — because he sought relief from nature instead of arguably dangerous, legal and often lethal pharmaceuticals, courtesy of Big Pharma. Worse, Alabama’s already irrational law sets the cutoff in a case like this at 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram), and Brooker’s plants weighed just 2.8 pounds — but that included unusable parts, like stalks and leaves. 
Make no mistake — this is an unjust law, an unjust conviction, and a ridiculous capitulation by the Supreme Court to Alabama’s archaic notion a nonviolent offense should somehow land a vet behind bars for life and separate him from his medicine — as if law were an inflexible monster to be beholden to, no matter its worth. 
In fact, as the Times pointed out, “[W]hile the sentence was mandatory, the prosecutor was not required to bring the precise charges that triggered it. Prosecutorial discretion here, as in most cases, is a central factor in determining what punishment defendants face.” 
In other words, the prosecutor railroaded Brooker over his personal, medicinal plants — by choice. Brooker, who joined the U.S. Army at age 17 and came under fire in both Lebanon and the Dominican Republic, eventually rose to the rank of sergeant in the 82nd Airborne — where he was decorated for infantry service. 
Vox reported that even “notoriously conservative” Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore characterized Brooker’s sentence as “excessive and unjustified.” And according to the Times , the judge deciding the vet’s fate would have preferred to hand down a lighter sentence, but once the charges had been brought as they were, he was obligated to enforce the letter of the law. 
Yes, this disabled man technically broke the law; but proffering such a rebuttal rings hollow, if not cold, considering the majority of Americans support cannabis legalization. Legality does not dictate morality. 
A growing segment of officials and public figures do, as well, as The Free Thought Project reported recently , more than 1,000 police, world leaders, celebrities, and others signed a letter calling to summarily end the disastrous war on drugs. 
In fact, though little comfort to Brooker now, the Drug Enforcement Agency will likely downgrade cannabis from its inexplicable Schedule 1 classification to Schedule 2 — as early as July of this year. Note that while a plethora of viable arguments can be asserted for rescheduling, considering states with laws like Alabama’s — and cases like Brooker’s — the slight concession by federal law would make a comparative, whopping difference. 
Brooker attempted to bring his case before the highest court in the land as an inarguable violation of the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment — to no avail. The court’s stonewall, in itself, could be considered as much — in an increasing number of states, Brooker’s so-called crime would have been perfectly legal. 
For now, though, it appears the 76-year-old will suffer the consequences of bad policy, unjustifiable law, and the cruelty of ostensible authority figures who were all just doing their jobs.

"title: Carville Melts Down: Asserts FBI, GOP and KGB in Cahoots author: PatriotRising text: Posted 10/31/2016 3:17 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an ‘attack’ on American democracy in MSNBC tantrum 
Famed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton’s private email server. 

In an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly — and repeatedly — attacked the FBI’s decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. 

“This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. “It’s unprecedented … the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. 

Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton conspiracy organized by the FBI, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey’s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. 

He was also adamant about who was responsible. “Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,” Carville said. “We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,” he claimed. 
Carville was very upset that Comey’s announcement thrust Clinton’s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. “It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn’t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that’s what happened here — there’s nothing else that’s going on — and in the meantime … democracy is under assault by the KGB,” he said. “To me that’s something we ought to be talking about.” 

Unfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP’s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton’s brazen lawlessness. 
When the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI’s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots ‘Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy’ Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated 

“When the facts change I change my mind,” Carville said. “Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?” he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats’ clear double standard 

“This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,” Carville repeated. “And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.”"
"title: Surviving Off-grid: 5 Ways to Manage Chimney Creosote author: Carmela Tyrell text: Carmela Tyrell November 6, 2016 Surviving Off-grid: 5 Ways to Manage Chimney Creosote 
The government is doing everything it can to deter people from burning wood , it still remains popular with home owners that don’t want to use oil or other more expensive fuels. Wood is also very popular with off gridders, preppers, and homesteaders because it can be harvested from natural resources or grown for this purpose. 
Many people that burn wood are plagued by creosote that builds up in chimneys. As dangerous as this problem can become, preventing or reducing creosote buildup is not as hard as it seems to be. 
Here are five ways you can reduce or prevent creosote buildup in your chimneys. 
Do not forget to inspect your chimneys on a regular basis and clean them even if the creosote only looks like it is in the early stages of buildup. 
How Does Creosote Form? 
Have you ever blown on a mirror or piece of glass so that some of the water vapor from your lungs condenses on the glass? If so, then you may also know that condensation occurs because the glass is cooler than the air exiting your mouth. 
In a similar way, when hot gas and smoke enter the chimney, they are hotter than the stove pipe. If the pipe is not hot enough, then creosote will condense out of the smoke and be deposited in the chimney. Video first seen on Corey Binford . 
The Three Degrees of Creosote Buildup 
As with many other situations in life, creosote build up may not be especially dangerous at first. However, if it is left unchecked, or not taken care of soon enough, it can become a very expensive problem. As you review the three degrees of creosote buildup, bear in mind that simply cleaning up the mess is only part of the problem. You will still need to take active steps to prevent or at least slow down further creosote buildup. 
1st Degree 
Just about every chimney will build up layers of soft black material known as soot. If you can easily brush the black layer of material out of the chimney, chances are there is actually very little creosote in it. 
Many people consider this a good sign because it means the fire is burning hot enough to reduce the amount of temperature difference between the smoke and the chimney. While this stage isn’t especially dangerous, you will still need to clean out the chimney on a routine basis in order to keep good air flow. 
2nd Degree 
At this level, you will start to see more creosote in the soot. There will be quite a few shiny black flakes of material that can still be removed if you put some effort into it. If you see this kind of soot, it is very important to increase the air flow in the burning area. 
3rd Degree 
This type of creosote buildup forms layers of a tar like coating on inner surfaces of the chimney. If you think about how cholesterol builds up in arteries, then you have a pretty good picture of what I mean. 
3 rd Degree creosote also contains a good bit of unburned fuel . As a result, when it does catch fire, it can be quite dangerous. The third degree of creosote buildup is caused by cool burning fires with inadequate ventilation, or by a flue that is too large. 
Here are five ways to resolve this type of buildup. You may need a combination of answers in order to reduce the level of creosote buildup as much as possible. 
1. Keep a Robust Airflow 
Have you ever lit a candle, and then put it in a glass cup? If so, then you have also probably seen soot build up on the sides of the glass. 
When a fire burns under any kind of restricted air flow, the soot from the fire will also concentrate and condense into smaller areas. Typically, fireplaces that have glass doors, or are otherwise closed off will have the most problems with airflow. 
Here’s what you can do to remedy this problem: Keep the ash bin and grate area as clean as possible. Open the damper so that more air gets into the fireplace. If you cannot get enough air moving in the fireplace, try using a fan or blower to push more air in through the damper. Make sure that the fan is made of metal or some other non-flammable material. Aside from purchasing a new model, you may also find some old, or vintage blowers at a flea market for a much lower price. Never underestimate the power or durability of these old, but incredibly durable blowers and fans! In some cases, downdrafts from the outside can also cause poor air circulation inside the stove. You can try adding a partial cover to the top of outer pipe. Alternatively, add an insert with an inward curve that will also reduce the amount of downdraft that can get down the chimney. 
2. Keep the Fire Hot 
Even though you may think of a piece of wood as a single object, it is actually made up of all kinds of molecules. This, in turn, means that some molecules will have a higher kindling point than others. 
If the fire is not hot enough, some of the molecules that require a hotter temperature will escape into the chimney and form a layer of creosote if the conditions are right. Later on, if the temperature inside the chimney gets hot enough, these particles will catch fire and burn. 
The hotter the fire is, the better chance there is of these molecules being reduced to heat and ash in the fireplace. In addition, the hotter the fire is, the hotter the chimney will be. When the chimney is hot enough, all the gunk that forms creosote cannot collect. 
Here are some ways to increase the heat output from a wood fire: add a few handfuls of coal to the wood fire. Coal burns at a higher temperature and will also last longer. Without a question, anyone that has used a coal fire on a freezing winter night can tell you just how delightful they are! install heat retaining bricks in the fireplace. This will increase the temperature inside the burn area and help keep the temperature steadier. insulate the chimney pipe with bricks. This is especially important if you are using a metal chimney, as they will always be cooler on the inner surface. The insulation will help, however it will not entirely solve the problem if it is caused by using a metal chimney. 
3. Check the Size of the Flue 
Consider a situation where you want to heat up a cup of coffee over a campfire. Chances are it will only take a few minutes to achieve this goal. Now let’s say you want to heat up a gallon of water over the exact same campfire. 
Heating up a gallon of water will take longer than a cup because there are more atoms to deal with. In a similar way, when the flue is too large, there is simply too much material for the fire to contend with. A wood stove should not have a flue larger than six inches. 
When you reduce the size of the flue, it allows less heat to escape. Some people have noticed a 20% or better increase in heat produced by fireplaces that have an optimally sized flue. Therefore, you will be reducing creosote problems and get more heat at the same time. 
Depending on the construction of the stove and chimney system, you may not be able to simply rip the whole thing out and start over again. Your best option will be to insert a sleeve into the chimney so that it has a smaller internal diameter. Even though these sleeves are usually made of metal, the surrounding brick in the chimney should keep it warm enough to reduce the risk of creosote build up. If you still get too much creosote, focus on increasing the heat produced by the fire and the amount of air flow going up into the chimney. Remember, the more air flow you have going up the chimney, the harder it will be for particles to stay still long enough to attach to inner surfaces. You may also want to let the wood season longer than a few months, and choose some type of wood other than pine. Look for wood that has less resin or sap in it. It is also very important to stay away from pellets or other types of pre-manufactured wood because they may be designed to burn at lower temperatures than what you will need to heat up an over sized chimney. 
4. Make Sure the Wood is Fully Seasoned and Dry 
Have you ever tried to start a fire during or after it rains? If you are camping, chances are you use a number of methods to dry the wood out as much as possible so that it produces more heat than smoke. 
In a similar way, when wood is not fully seasoned and dried out, it will produce more creosote. Fires that produce a lot of smoke also have the following problems: there is less airflow, which reduces the amount of oxygen available to the fire the fire will burn cooler because water impedes combustion smoke is also a sign that more fuel is escaping into the air than you would get from a cleaner burning fire. 
There is no substitute for time when it comes to seasoning wood. You can try keeping logs closer to the fire place for a few days before you actually burn them. Just remember to rotate them often so that the log dries out more evenly. 
Chopping the log into smaller pieces might help too. This will increase surface area, which in turn will speed up water evaporation. You will still need to rotate the wood around to ensure the fastest possible drying. 
When it comes to seasoning wood , many people make the mistake of covering the wood with a waterproof, air tight tarp. The wood will release water vapor, however it will fall right back onto the wood and be absorbed all over again. 
You will be better served by keeping the wood loosely covered and in a warm, sunny spot while it is drying. As with drying the wood out indoors, do not forget to rotate the woodpile every few days so that the pieces dry out as much and as evenly as possible. 
If the weather is especially damp, humid, or rainy, it may be of some help to cut the wood into smaller pieces. No matter how you look at it, increasing surface area always speeds up evaporation. It may seem like a lot of extra work, however it will pay off when you have hotter fires   and fewer problems with creosote. 
5. Do Not Overload the Stove With Wood 
When you have had a long, hard day, it is tempting to load the stove with as much wood as possible so you won’t have to add more through the night. On the other side of the equation, when you put too much wood in the stove, it reduces air flow. 
Aside from this, when fires burn, they also release some water vapor. When there is too much wood in the stove, some of that vapor may just land on the wood and increase its moisture level. No matter how well seasoned the wood is, that increased moisture will cause the fire to burn poorly. 
Here are some ways to resolve this problem: start off by adding just one piece at a time to the fire. If the fire burns well, try adding a second piece. Keep adding more pieces as long as the fire burns cleanly. Do not forget that you may not be able to add as many pieces at one time on rainy days or ones where it is impossible to prevent a downdraft from the chimney. install an automatic wood feeder. Even thought a wood feeder can take up a good bit of space, it may be a better solution than trying to manually feed the stove. Use coal and other materials that might burn longer during times when you won’t be available to feed the stove more wood. 
Wherever you live in (an apartment or a house), chances are the building will have a chimney, and there will also be a stove available for burning wood . Getting started with wood burning is not especially difficult, but avoiding creosote buildup in the chimney can be challenge. 
Be careful about the condition of the fire, the wood, and ventilation issues that may lead to creosote buildup. Once you find a way to reduce the speed of creosote buildup, do not forget to inspect the chimney on a regular basis. 
A clean chimney is not just a safe one, it is a valuable asset that will help you burn wood efficiently and get the most from it.

"title: US faces host of global threats during transition until next president author: Kaitlyn Stegall text: November 7, 2016 US faces host of global threats during transition until next president 
Sharks are circling as the US prepares to vote, on the lookout for signs of American weakness and indecision around the world during the months-long transition period until the next president is firmly established in the White House. Call it a window of vulnerability. 
No matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west may try to exploit America’s power vacuum. 
The problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a “lame duck” president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant. 
Once installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process."

"title: DNC Renews Lawsuit Against RNC Over Voter Intimidation (VIDEO) author: Lisa Bonanno text: DNC Renews Lawsuit Against RNC Over Voter Intimidation (VIDEO) By Lisa Bonanno on October 29, 2016 
According to a document filed in federal court this past Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee is taking Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee to task over their plans to “monitor” the polls. 
The filing says that the RNC is violating a consent decree by: “… Supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ‘rigged’ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ‘certain areas’ or ‘certain sections’ of key states. Unsurprisingly, those ‘certain areas’ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.” 
The document goes on to name some of the specific quotes and directives that Donald Trump has given supporters. It also mentions that: “Following the third presidential debate, Trump’s campaign manager told a reporter that the campaign was working to combat purported voter fraud by ‘actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.'” 
This shows that the RNC is involved in this effort, which has already begun . Trump ally Roger Stone organized “Vote Protectors,” who are instructed to conduct “exit polls.” Initially, the volunteers were asked to upload video of voters, create ID badges and wear red shirts at specific polling places. After journalistic inquiry , Stone said he would change his tactics. He simply created a new website, but that’s another story. 
The Democratic National Committee is going after Trump and the RNC for violation of a consent decree signed in 1982. At that time, the RNC was involved in voter suppression in targeted areas known to vote predominantly Democrat. They hired off-duty sheriffs and police officers to go to polling places in those areas displaying a sign stating “This area is being patrolled by the National Ballot Security Task Force.” There were other activities, such as the challenge of individual voter registrations in certain communities. 
The consent decree forcing the RNC to cease its 1982 “ballot security” activities resulted from a successful DNC suit. The decree expires next year. In the current suit, the DNC seeks to renew it for another eight years. 
34 years later, we have an old tactic re-branded by the same party to do the same thing: intimidate minority voters. The DNC opens fire against RNC voter intimidation tactics

"title: Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant author: Kaitlyn Stegall text: October 28, 2016 Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement. Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela’s socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. “Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?” said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. “We are sick of this. It’s time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,” added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad."
"title: Why I Am A Homesteader And Why You Should Be To author: Josh Stockton text: Keywords: Better Tasting Food , GMOs , homestead , Homesteading 
If you clicked a link that got you to this page, you can’t pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer. I’m not sure if you are afraid of the effort, afraid that you won’t know what to do, or what you are afraid of, but it’s time to get up and get going. 
I have been homesteading for over 15 years and wouldn’t change it for anything in the world. My husband and I have made many mistakes along the way, but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done. For all our hard work, we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving. 
We all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading, so don’t base yours off of mine. I am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality. I Provide Healthy Food For My Family 
We are not vegan, vegetarian, of allergic to gluten, but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies. I just don’t like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically. I also don’t like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that I don’t know about. 
Everything that I put on my kitchen table, to feed my family, has been grown or produced by me or someone I know. I know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil, water, and a little alpaca poop for good measure. The pork also came from our farm, and I know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life. 
I’m not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world, but I know we aren’t eating chemicals . That is what matters to me and my husband! The Food Tastes So Much Better 
The food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store. The truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can, as fast as they can. They don’t want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better. 
The meat also takes better because you aren’t rushing that either. Not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food. When you slaughter the food yourself, it will taste better as well. Animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead. Freedom 
Not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day. Now, that doesn’t mean that we don’t have responsibilities, but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert. We can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isn’t insane. 
If you want to get freedom over your own life, start homesteading today ! We Have Economic Security 
If the economy crashes, we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need. We don’t rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities, including a source of income. We have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead. There isn’t much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk. 
I am not an apocalypse prepper, but I will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur. We have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people I know. Our Kids Understand The Meaning of Hard Work 
I’m not saying that your kids don’t understand the meaning of hard work, but my kids have been there and done that. My nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day. Those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that. 
I do allow my kids to use electronics during down time, they just know the difference between down time and chore time. They feel like they are part of the team, so it doesn’t feel like we are making them do chores every day. You might also like…"
"title: Strange Silence of Neo-Con Trolls as Mikheil Saakashvili Stabs His Patron Poroshenko in the Back author: Mark Almond text: Written by Mark Almond   The sudden resignation of Mikheil Saakashvili as Governor of Odessa and his accompanying tirade of accusations of corruption and treason against the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko and his coterie in Kiev came as a bombshell for the Western media on 7th November. But it was a strangely bland bombshell. Yes, the voices of the West - the BBC, CNN, the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty – mentioned that the former Georgian President, who had been brought in to combat corruption in Ukraine’s key port and one of its major Russian-speaking cities, had resigned, even that he criticised his patron and old university chum, Poroshenko, for being on the take. But the reportage has been strangely opaque. Remember both Saakashvili and Poroshenko had been routinely characterised as the epitome of anti-corruption campaigners by Western neo-con voices whose echo-chamber is the supposedly liberal media, CNN, NBC in the USA and BBC and Channel Four News in the UK. No mention of Poroshenko’s past service to the “notoriously corrupt” regimes in Ukraine before 2014 is permitted, nor reference to his alleged business dealings with pariahs like Iran before he came on board for the regime-change of the decade in February, 2014. As for the reality that to most Georgians their ex-president, President, Mikheil Saakashvili, was the personification of a brutal, loud-mouthed demagogue that too was passed over in silence by those who boast that “they tell truth to power” from the editorial suites of Western newsrooms and newspapers. Saakashvili’s own people remember how it was exactly nine years ago on 7th November, 2007, that his Western equipped para-military police smashed demonstrations against him in Tbilisi with a mixture of high-tech ultra-low frequency disorientation weapons and swagger sticks and jackboots. The anniversary of Lenin’s seizure of power ninety-nine years ago has strange fascination for Saakashvili as his day for decisive coups. After his fall from power in Georgia four years ago, Saakashvili had become a kind of post-Communist Flying Dutchman albeit inverted. Abandoned by his Dutch wife after revelations of the crudest kind of tax-payer-funded infidelities, he roamed the West trying to find sanctuary. Even the USA quietly but firmly denied him a haven as revelations that underneath his glass-fronted police stations – much-vaunted in the Guardian and Transitions online as model reforms - secret dungeons housed torture and sexual abuse against his opponents have shattered his reputation at home and were known to insiders abroad. Saakashvili has of course embarrassed his US sponsors before by launching unilateral action without consulting them and getting full permission in advance. Remember how in August, 2008, he thought he could overrun South Ossetia before Russia could react and would earn the plaudits of the neo-cons in the West for his “courageous leadership”. Instead, he provoked a Russian backlash and the disintegration of his army. In a grand strategy worthy of Mussolini’s placement of his best troops in Ethiopia before invading Greece and Libya with badly equipped conscripts, Saakashvili had sent his 6,000 US-trained troops to do garrison duty in Iraq for his American sponsors when he decided to provoke Russia in 2008. The worthless adventure shattered Saakashvili’s value to the West less than a year after it had ignored his brutal suppression of opposition and had endorsed yet another rigged presidential election in his favour. Ousted by even some of his ex-cronies after 2012, it was his old university contemporary, Petro Poroshenko, who threw a lifeline to the ex-Georgian President and a slew of his ex-enforcers from Georgia. Rather as the old Soviet Communist Party had deployed loyal apparatchiks from outside each republic to enforce the Kremlin’s will on the multi-ethnic population of the USSR, so Washington now backed a strategy of parachuting outsiders from other ex-Soviet republics and of course the children of Nazi-era emigres from Ukraine itself into key positions to control the Ukrainian people themselves in case they took it into their heads to take democracy seriously. The Americans often overlooked the internal contradictions of this parody of Comintern tactics. Saakashvili was notoriously anti-Armenian in power in Georgia, when he bulldozed scores of ancient Armenian buildings in Tbilisi to make way for his Reichstag-look-alike presidential palace. So it wasn’t by chance that he got into a brawl with the ethnic Armenian interior minister of “independent” Ukraine last year. Saakashvili’s arrival in largely-Russian-speaking Odesa was a red rag to the locals. They resisted his attempt to massage local elections in favour of his preferred candidates for mayor and so on as he had done back home in Georgia. He denounced the opposition as corrupt but at best this was the pot calling the kettle black. Saakashvili’s own tarnished reputation went before him across the Black Sea even if seminars in Oxford or Harvard took his credentials as “Mr Clean” at face value. Now his wrestling match with the Ukrainian mafia and his attempt to impose his own Georgian clan in Odessa has come into the open. The publication of the Panama Papers was supposed to tarnish Vladimir Putin but in reality the dirt spewed out of Poroshenko for his murky Caribbean cash pile. Just as the revelation of David Cameron’s family ties to offshore accounts fatally undermined his standing in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. Poroshenko’s claims to represent Westernization for Ukraine were not without an ironic plausibility. Then to compound Poroshenko’s credibility gap as an anti-corruption campaigner, an MP of Soros-sponsored Afghan Communist background got a bill passed with American backing requiring politicians and officials to publish declarations of their wealth. The published amounts commonly enraged ordinary, poverty-stricken Ukrainians even if they were often a shadow of the real wealth stashed away by the representatives of the people. Having come to power by decrying Viktor Yanukovich’s alleged “orgy of corruption”, the Poroshenko crew looked odiously bloated with inexplicable wealth. Into the scandal stepped the unpopular, alien governor Odessa. Despite being appointed by the President, Saakashvili chose to denounce him personally for betraying the Ukrainian people, Western values and the anti-mafia crusade which Saakashvili claimed to personify. Western media express surprise at the ferocity of Saakashvili’s attacks on the integrity of his old university friend, Poroshenko, who had rescued him from exile and given him his new lease of political life in Odessa. Don’t these hacks remember how Saakashvili had been raised up by Georgia’s Eduard Shevardnadze, who became godfather to his protégé’s son, Eduard, while he was Minister of [In]Justice in that cruelly corrupt regime, before Saakashvili turned on his patron and ousted him in the so-called “Rose Revolution” in November, 2003? Now thirteen unlucky years later, Saakashvili has bitten the hand that fed him in Ukraine. Part of the Western media’s amnesia is of course that until yesterday both Saakashvili and Poroshenko were portrayed as model reformers, anti-corruption campaigners and so on. Suddenly, one paragon of civic virtue smears the other. CNN, BBC and Wall St. Journal can’t compute it. Clearly, no-one in the Central Information Agency had distributed the script in advance of this crisis – so unlike the well-signalled abandonment of a Western darling like Shevardnadze in 2003 or the preparations for the Maidan uprising in 2013-14. Then of course, the Amanpours et al. were on hand with the moniker and mood music to encapsulate the propaganda line. Yesterday’s hero was now a villain but forget about Shevardnadze or Kuchma, here comes an English-speaking motor-mouth spewing out all the New World Order guff about civil society, anti-corruption and, of course, Russophobia. The Saakashvili-Porodshenko spat not only casts a garish light on the sleazy reality of Western-backed regime change on either side of the Black Sea – Georgia as well as Ukraine – but more importantly it illustrates the dangerous tailspin into which the casual promotion of corrupt and unstable post-Soviet politicians as paragons of civic virtue has plunged Western policy in Eastern Europe. The recent uptick in sabre-rattling by NATO reflects the bankruptcy of the political options promoted by the Euro-Atlantic regime-changers. Having toppled and re-toppled post-Communist regimes, promoting and then pulling down successive corrupt and brutal “heroes of the street”, the West now faces the grim reality that its reputation is as tarnished by this sleazy process as much as its former local heroes. Maybe one of the youthful Najibullahs of Kiev will be pushed to fill the void. But don’t underrate the ability of Ukraine’s oligarchs to navigate the storms of post-Communist politics and never ending flow of embarrassing revelations of hypocrisy and corruption which the Dnieper can never wash away. Saakashvili has declared war in a most Hobbesian environment on the most powerful and odious characters in the country. Above all, he has denigrated the President of Ukraine himself whose authority cannot survive allowing his former protégé to abuse him with impunity. This cannot end well for both men. No-one should be surprised if Saakashvili and Poroshenko are suddenly reconciled, but any embrace of these two old comrades from the Komsomol can only follow Lenin’s dictum: put your arms around the enemy’s shoulders so you get your hands closer to his throat. Saakashvili may be counting on the Americans to save his bacon. He seems to have forgotten what President Sarkozy told him in August, 2008: “The Seventh Cavalry is not coming over the hill to rescue you.” Ultimately, even the global nation par excellence does not believe that a Georgian political clan can takeover Ukraine and rule it for Washington against the will of the Ukraine’s own mafias. Saakashvili’s impulsive detonation of this crisis might lead other Ukrainians to pose as champions of probity against Poroshenko, but the West’s international brigade of reformers who failed at home sent in to transform Ukraine have had their day. Some slink back home to the Baltic States or Chicago, but Saakashvili has no homeland anymore. With his Georgian citizenship revoked, and Tbilisi demanding his extradition for a host of alleged crimes in office from 2003 until 2012, Saakashvili has few places to run to. Remember the USA wouldn’t give him permanent residence which was why he jumped at the chance to serve Poroshenko’s bogus anti-corruption but very real anti-Russian drive in Odessa. With the boss-of-bosses’ backing in Kiev, Saakashvili could find himself facing extradition back to Georgia – or even to Russia which accused him of genocide for killing so many civilians in his madcap invasion of South Ossetia in August, 2008. The West can afford to throw away Saakashvili. Poroshenko and his prime minister, Groysman – godson of Poroshenko’s father – have been Washington’s key allies in Kiev. If they were to fall, or, if fearing Washington was about to push them, they jumped ship back to their old comrades in Moscow, the neo-cons’ house of cards in Eastern Europe could collapse. Maybe the strange silence of the West’s normally vocal media analysts about Saakashvili’s bombshell reflects their bewilderment that the best-laid plans for domination in the East are beginning to crumble like one of the stale cookies handed out in Kiev by that pin-up for regime-change, Victoria Neuland. After all the hullaballoo about Donald Trump being the cat’s paw of pro-Russian interests who had backed Viktor Yanukovich in the swirling crisis in Ukraine three years ago, that none of the hacks decrying his “hidden Kremlin links” have explained how Saaki and Porky Poroshenko fell out so spectacularly or what it means for Western grand strategy. Their silence is very revealing. Even Google’s Orwellian approach to news-management has rarely been so crude: the story was a bombshell, headlined with “live updates” – but not anymore. Amnesia not analysis is increasingly the Western media elite’s response to the crisis besetting its most cherished policies. Does this silence imply retreat or will the West lash out after Tuesday’s US Presidential election? Maybe Saakashvili’s tantrum will set the Seventh Cavalry in motion, not to rescue him today any more than in 2008, but to mask the failure of regime-change with open war in the East. Now that is something the Western media has been talking about a lot recently. Reprinted with permission from author's website . Related"
"title: Election 2016: Open Thread author: WashingtonsBlog text: Orangutan. 
Rigged. Worth trying but its not a fair game. Smartmatic style Diebold type machines and software will count the votes and the corporate controlled media will announce the results. No mention of Election Fraud or the problems of the past. Long live Mike Connell, Clint Curtis, Bev Harris, Brad Friedman, RFK Jr. and other whistleblowers who have tried to fight for our democracy. Will only get worse from here it seems. Always hopeful though. David S 
Government will win as always. Freedom will lose as always. The ruling elite control most elected officials and hundreds of thousands of government bureaucrats legislate unconstitutionally from their offices. We sit upon $20 Trillion in real debt and another $250+Trillion in unfunded liabilities. Trump wishes to increase military spending and Hillary never met a war she didn’t support (on behalf of her puppetmasters of course). Our medical system is nearly completely destroyed by over a century of government micromanagement and collusion with the AMA. We have more people incarcerated than nearly every other country on earth – mostly for non-violent drug offenses – and neither candidate looks to have the courage or the desire to truly allow freedom in this area (though Trump shows the greatest hope). Our government/CIA/other black ops groups, etc. are working tirelessly to undermine governments around the world, incite violence, and provoke armed conflict – maybe even nuclear – all for the benefit of the arms cartel and banksters who profit from every war. The people of America clearly have NO interest in restoring freedom, liberty, private property rights, business rights, sound money, etc. anymore. This “rebellion” that has gotten behind Trump still needs to bear fruit with regards to demanding REAL change at the federal and state levels. What will come of the following months is to be seen, but I suspect, as with so many previous “rebellions,” these folks will go back to their televisions, iPads, and Playstations and will forget about the fundamental corruption and crony capitalism that is destroying this country so long as they get a few bones thrown their way to pacify them. Let us hope something far more profound comes of it all. Time for a drink. kimyo 
fwiw: a screencap of ‘final’ results displayed on 11/2 (apparently by accident) by nbc station wrcb-tv shows: popular vote: clinton 41,765,317 / trump 40,124,438, electoral college: clinton 343 / trump 195. 
although the early reporting showing trump with a commanding lead matches my take on american sentiment, my cynical side suspects that it is the msm’s way of getting out the later-voting clinton supporters 
if anonymous were a real thing, today’s show would be have been completely different. real hackers don’t waste their precious time defacing websites. 
ps: if trump does win, i picture zuesse as the dog, who, after years of chasing, has finally caught that darn UPS truck. growling, jowls full of brown bumper, but with a dawning comprehension on his brow, realizing ‘well, exactly what do i do now?’ Orangutan. 
Continuity of Gov’t plans have been implemented and in place. Dept of Homeland Security is now running our elections. The results will not be publicly available for review anymore according to Bev Harris. Similar to the results in California where the primary was announced for Hillary but Bernie may have actually ended up winning there. Welcome to the 1984 style Continuity of Government plan and Department of Homeland Security run elections thanks to the public’s refusal to emotionally or intellectually acknowledge the truth about 9/11 or the false flag anthrax attacks that followed. TruthTime 
Especially agree with the comment about the Anthrax attack. The criminals are still at large for that blatantly, obvious state-sponsored crime. I laughed when Obama’s Administration decided to shut down any investigation into it. 
America is a Nation of subjects who are continually subjected to the lies and falsehoods of their elected leaders. We have state crimes going far back to the era of JFK. People that still think Corruption isn’t really that bad in Washington, that it’s all a “conspiracy theory.” Carl_Herman 
Thank you for asking, GW. It’s not an “election” when it fails to meet that definition due to multiple methods for election fraud. It’s not for a “US president” therefore, but an appointed “leader.” And, it’s not reported by media, but the appointers’ propaganda minions. 
Of course, if we continue this argument with ~100 other points centered in lie-started Wars of Aggression, bankster-looting, and lying about near everything important, we can’t even call it the US as defined by our Constitution. 
So, where do we go from here? 
Start with truth. Then see what develops. Charlie Primero 
Carl, this vote shows that all the people you have been trying to “wake up” to the corruption and graft are waking up. 
This is just the beginning. Be happy. MyWikiDisQus 
It does not matter what we think or do or say anymore. The republic has been overthrown by the plutocrats who remain in power as long as the citizenry believe in the concocted and fraudulent electoral system they fabricated that selects the candidate who serves them, not the people. Participation of the masses is necessary to grant them the mandate to ensure the continuity of their reign that has continually impoverished the majority of the nation. 
In the beginning representative government in America was a wonderful experiment that has since devolved, brick by brick, decade by decade into a shell of its former creation to become a bastion of despotism. The poor are still slaves, indentured to the government by onerous debt as Negros were to their 19 century plantations masters; only the title of ownership has changed. The middle class, once a foundation of prosperity has now become an economic ghost, relegated to the status of freemen of the peasant class. 
The wealthy are richer in material possession, millionaires become billionaires and the government siphons off from the upper class to enrich itself by political favor, by statute and regulation, by ignoring the rule of equal justice under the law. 
How long will the people tolerate this abomination of corrupt authority? What will be the future event that triggers the entire country to say, “Enough!”? Will it be a complete economic breakdown of society or the devastation of nuclear war on our soil? 
“We the People” have the power, we have always possessed it. The time of reconciliation is upon us, we must balance the ledger of liberty back in our favor. The only way to peacefully do it is reject the system that oppresses us. Do not engage with them, do not obey them, tell them their lies carry no truth, we see through the veil of falsity and reject it and demand a new path to opportunity and happiness for all who are willing to work towards it. TruthTime 
The U.S. is fucked. 
But it needs to collapse now or within 100 years for people to totally realize they were duped. It is the only way to start anew. kimyo 
according to zh, trump has ohio, florida and north carolina. 
my top 3 questions: 1) will there be a thorough investigation of the clinton foundation? 2) what will he do if the next 9/11 happens on his watch? 3) will he kill cop21 and defund global warming research? diogenes 
One thing is utterly clear: if Trump wins, the wholly Wall Street owned Democratic Party gave it to him by rigging primaries to put the Clinton criminal gang on the ballot. 
Because Bernie would have won — won with the votes not only of millions of nominally “Democratic” voters who rightly can’t stomach Clinton and didn’t vote for her (whether we voted Green, or Libertarian or Trump or stayed home) — but also with the votes of millions who are voting Trump because he appears to at least not be part of the Wall Street criminal gang of hereditary oligarchs. Tim Chambers 
Looks like Trump will be President and free to do as he pleases. The Repug’s bet on Scalia’s seat has been made good. The Democrats will now have to rethink identity politics and third way neoliberalism. I wonder if Obama will try to ram through the trade agreements and a few other monstrosities now during the lame duck session. 
Bye, Bye, Hillary, bye bye. It’s the one silver lining to the overhanging clouds. What a disaster of a candidate! Such arrogant over-confidence. And what a comeuppance for the party and its big money backers! It is going to cost them a lot of money to into Trumps good graces. 
All we need now is for Trump to sell out his working class supporters for the Democrats to return to a sincere class-based politics that brings back the independent voters. They should have given Bernie his rightful chance. 
Unfortunately, what we are likely to see is another attempt by the Clintons 4 years from now against Warren. Two losses isn’t likely to dissuade that bitch in the least. 
I told you back in April and again 2 weeks ago that Trump would win!! http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/10/donald-j-trump-will-win.html Tim Chambers

imagine if tomorrow trump says ‘yes, absolutely, we’re going to build that wall, but while we’re waiting for the check from mexico why don’t we find 500 out-of-work engineers and architects and 5,000 out-of-work construction folk and send them to flint to fix the water system.

cnn had a bad day today, but they’d be totally f’d tomorrow.

"title: Comment on Neoliberalism’s Border Guard by craazyboy author: craazyboy text: by Outis Philalithopoulos In the most recent episode of this series , the ghost of Outis had fun watching a Disney movie. Afterwards, he spoke with Zootopia ‘s star, Judy Hopps, about the movie’s sly humor, and its efficacy at stigmatizing prejudice and fostering empathy for the suffering of others. After my visit from Judy, I felt reinvigorated, ready to take a fresh look at the questions that had puzzled me. I could discern three large scale principles at work in deciding whom to include and whom to exclude from the liberal tent. One is postmodernism. One is smartness. And the third, seen clearly in Zootopia , is a consensus about the reality of certain kinds of suffering and trauma. During the past few decades, the importance of smartness has if anything increased. A college education has become a basic requirement for being middle class, and parents of all political stripes scrabble desperately to get their children into the “best” schools. The credentialing sectors of capitalism have been dominated by liberals for decades, but only recently have we successfully leveraged this strategic asset into the idea that liberals are basically the same as educated people. Other sites of cultural production – Hollywood, television, marketing, social media corporations – are also stereotypically liberal, and have become much more responsive to pressure from progressives. Movies like Zootopia , watched by millions of parents and children, show how it is possible to direct corporate power toward positive goals. We have succeeded in dividing capitalism into two halves, one still ugly and irredeemable, but the other (the cultural and credentialing sectors) tamed, dynamic, and fashionable. We absorb into our alliance everyone from marketing professionals to college professors to people who just like the Daily Show, reinforcing our sense of truth by identifying things as stupid, backwards, or insane. Looking now at the other two principles – postmodernism and suffering – Wendy Brown foretold that, as foci, they would be unable to coexist. Since the time of her prediction, the balance between the two has shifted dramatically, and it has become clear that Brown was rooting for the losing side. Postmodernism lamented the modern world’s lack of orienting fixed points, and maybe tried to make a virtue out of this disorientation. Maybe, as I suggested to Foucault, it tried to establish the insistent assertion of the lack of fixed points as its own fixed point, and then covered the maneuver in a bewildering morass of verbiage. The contrast with the familiar liberalism of today is stark. We have reconstructed ourselves as progressives, burying postmodernism and reconstituting a robust sense of absolute morality and truth. The process took some time to gather steam, but is now at the helm of mainstream culture. Although we believe in some positive ideals like education, we have been especially successful at vanquishing the corrosive doubts of postmodernism by setting up negative ideals as transcendentally true. At the center of our imagination are atrocities like slavery, genocide, rape – these no one can doubt, these are things to which at one’s peril one refuses to kneel. Who can deny that they exist, that they hurt, that they are evil? We therefore pick out vivid episodes in which certain groups of people suffered, and make it clear that anyone that does not ritually acknowledge the reality of their suffering is unworthy to be part of society. In this way, we manage to stigmatize horrible, regressive behavior, but that isn’t enough. High profile instances of genocide and torture don’t appear every day, and commitment flags without regular stimulation. And so we have taken seriously at least one idea from postmodernism, the fascination with slight conceptual nuances, and the faith or fear that these nuances can produce enormously consequential effects. We focus not just on torture but also on less obviously brutal but still hurtful behavior (“micro-aggressions”); not just on behavior but on language, not just on language but also on thoughts. By discouraging hurtful speech and sensitizing people to implicit bias, we make the world a more pleasant place. Critics of progressives complain about “political correctness,” but you can’t forge a unitary culture without imposing boundaries, and we mainly focus on obvious principles of good manners and consideration toward others. Zootopia as an Allegory Although there is still a long way to go, the progress of our culture toward liberation is historically unparalleled. Zootopia provides an extensive allegory about our achievement. We naturally dread the uncivilized past. One symbol of the past is the pathetic figure of Judy’s parents, who tell her to settle and not follow her dreams. More frighteningly, the plot of the movie revolves around the mysterious fact that some animals are reverting to wildness – the past is thus not merely the past, but threatens to return. There is a still more insidious threat, which is the possibility that some part of the past remains lodged inside of us, like the specks of evil that St. Augustine once believed that God places in us in order to foil our efforts to attain goodness on our own. This fear is hardly surprising, given that we have come to a consensus that certain ways of talking that just twenty or even ten years ago passed without comment in liberal circles are, in reality, clearly problematic. The climax of Zootopia is when Judy, without any selfish or cruel intent, loses control of her mouth – and primitive, nonprogressive ideas escape from it. Zootopia doesn’t merely show us the shadow of the past, but also offers us, as individuals, hope in the exciting future. Judy avoids becoming a carrot farmer like her parents, and is able to move past the degrading experience of working as a “meter maid.” By virtue of being impressive, competent, and using the rules in her favor, she is able to rise to the top and be valued for her abilities. Leftists often worry that professional success can lead to people losing their moral compass. Zootopia offers a helpful perspective on this dilemma. When Judy reaches the pinnacle of success, that is precisely when she messes up and says problematic things. At first glance, Zootopia seems to suggest that morality is far more important than worldly success. Judy responds to her fault by taking a leave of absence from her job and feeling terrible. In the end, she is only able to redeem herself by treating herself as utterly worthless: by confessing abjectly to Nick, pronouncing herself damned, and handing him the only key that can set her free. I now realized, though, that the message of the movie was optimistic. True, if we say or think wrong things, we need to respond seriously, the way Judy did. But if we do that – and if we express support for progressive ideals and acknowledge our privilege – then we can be as successful as we want to be. There doesn’t need to be any conflict between ambition and being a good person. That doesn’t mean that liberals have to care about professional success. If you want to care about people in Africa or the plight of the working class, that’s great, too. The important thing is that we come together on the important things, like basic moral principles and recognizing the suffering of marginalized groups. As this consensus consolidates, society will continue to progress. Some people will try to derail the process, maybe due to sensitivity about having been called out, or anger at losing their privilege. More and more, those people will be seen as throwbacks. Demographic forces will render them irrelevant. Maybe they will just be swept away by globalization. Or – maybe – they can work at the DMV. The Phantom A bell sounded and roused me from my vision of the future. There I saw a Phantom, draped and hooded, gliding like mist along the ground towards me. It was shrouded in a deep, black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing visible except one outstretched hand. “The Spirit of Liberalism Yet To Come, I presume?” I asked. The Spirit did not answer. I felt a stab of fear at what it might show me. Would the current positive trajectory continue? Would the future bring cultural progress in ways I couldn’t even imagine? Or would the 2020s instead feature a cyclical swing back to postmodernism? Or something worse still? The Spirit merely pointed onward with its hand. I followed it, and found myself listening to another speech, taking place not in the far future, but toward the end of 2016. Yet my sense of foreboding did not abate, and for apparently no reason at all, the cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces of my vision suddenly seemed insubstantial, and vain. I remain curious why the “debate” over antiracism as a politics takes such indirect and evasive forms – like the analogizing and guilt by association, moralistic bombast in lieu of concrete argument – and why it persists in establishing, even often while denying the move, the terms of debate as race vs. class. He seemed to refer to “antiracism” as if it were not an obviously good thing. I looked at his name plate. Adolph Reed? Who was this person? In the logic of antiracism, exposure of the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to a recognition of injustice, which will in turn lead to remedial action – though not much attentions seems ever given to how this part is supposed to work. I suspect this is because the exposure part, which feels so righteously yet undemandingly good, is the real focus. I did not understand why the sound of his voice troubled me so much. “Spirit!” I exclaimed, “this is a fearful place. I will not forget its lessons, trust me. Let me go!” But the Ghost only pointed, with an unmoved finger, at Reed, whose icy words burned in my ears. These responses [show] how fundamentally antiracism and other identitarian programs are not only the left wing of neoliberalism but active agencies in its imposition of a notion of the boundaries of the politically thinkable – sort of neoliberalism’s intellectual and cultural border guard. “Answer me one question,” I cried. “Are the things Reed says the shadows of things to come, or are they merely his own cynical perspective?” I caught at the Spirit’s spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but I persisted. Yet the Spirit was stronger than I was, and repulsed me. I fell to the ground, and when I arose, I was alone in the weeping land. * * * The series concludes tomorrow, with Outis reaching new conclusions and making an important decision.

"title: Will the next US president be a psycho lesbian? (plus 2 breaking news videos) author: Admin text: By Tom Leonard with pictures and captions added by Lasha Darkmoon 
Hillary Clin­ton faced an up­set in her run for the White House two days ago af­ter the FBI an­nounced a fresh probe into her emails. In­ves­ti­ga­tors will examine new mes­sages to see whether she sent clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion on a private server. Just ten days be­fore Amer­i­cans go to the polls, the Demo­crat candidate’s bid to be­come the first woman US pres­i­dent may be de­railed if it is de­cided she should face crim­i­nal charges. ‘I AM INNOCENT!’ Recent Polls sug­gest Mrs Clinton will trounce Repub­li­can ri­val Don­ald Trump, who has been strug­gling to fight al­le­ga­tions about grop­ing women. But Mrs Clin­ton will now be forced on the de­fen­sive her­self in the fi­nal days of their vi­cious elec­tion bat­tle. FBI di­rec­tor James Comey had rec­om­mended ear­lier this year that the Department of Jus­tice not press charges over emails sent by Mrs Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state un­der Barack Obama. But he said ‘re­cent de­vel­op­ments’ had prompted him to take an­other look. The agency has ob­tained new emails from an un­re­lated case that ‘ap­pear per­ti­nent’ to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, said Mr Comey. A ju­bi­lant Mr Trump hailed the dra­matic de­vel­op­ment of a re-opened investigation as ‘big­ger than Water­gate’, a ref­er­ence to the cor­rup­tion scan­dal that brought down Richard Nixon. ‘Bigger than Watergate’ The con­tro­versy has weighed heav­ily on the cam­paign, chal­leng­ing Mrs Clinton’s key con­tention that – un­like her opponent – she would be a safe pair of hands in the White House. Mr Comey an­nounced in July that the FBI’s 12-month investigation into Mrs Clinton’s con­tro­ver­sial email traf­fic while secretary of state was over. She was crit­i­cised for us­ing a pri­vate email server rather than the of­fi­cial system to trans­mit clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion, but escaped prose­cu­tion. In a harshly-worded crit­i­cism of her ‘ex­treme care­less­ness’ and ‘gross negligence’, Mr Comey said it was pos­si­ble that hos­tile for­eign govern­ments had gained ac­cess to her poorly-pro­tected ac­count. He also flatly con­tra­dicted var­i­ous Clinton claims al­though – in ex­plain­ing why he had not rec­om­mended pros­e­cut­ing her – he ac­cepted there was no evidence she had in­ten­tion­ally jeop­ar­dised state se­crets. The scan­dal has been bran­dished by Repub­li­cans as ev­i­dence of Mrs Clin­ton’s dis­hon­esty and in­com­pe­tence. Mr Comey informed Congress by let­ter that his agency had ob­tained new emails. They will be re­viewed to see if they are sig­nif­i­cant and if new ac­tion against Mrs Clin­ton is re­quired. Mr Comey did not give a time­frame for how long this in­ves­ti­ga­tion will take. The orig­i­nal FBI probe found that of 30,000 emails Mrs Clin­ton handed over to the State Depart­ment, 110 con­tained in­for­ma­tion that was clas­si­fied at the time she sent or re­ceived them. How­ever, an­other 33,000 emails went miss­ing. They were pre­sumed to have been per­ma­nently deleted but newly re­leased FBI notes sug­gested they still ex­ist in sev­eral locations and could be re­cov­ered. It is un­clear whether any of these are in­volved in the new FBI in­quiry. Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said the newly dis­cov­ered emails were taken from the elec­tronic de­vices of se­nior Clin­ton aide Huma Abe­din and her dis­graced hus­band An­thony Weiner dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the lat­ter’s ‘sex­ting’ of girls. ANTHONY WEINER AND HUMA ABEDIN 
LD : Huma is a Palestinian and rumored to be Hillary Clinton’s lesbian lover. Weiner is a Jewish sexual pervert who, incidentally, is passionate about gun control. He wants women to be disarmed, it has been said, so that sexual predators like himself can attack them more easily. 
Weiner, a for­mer Demo­crat con­gress­man for New York, be­came em­broiled in a se­ries of scan­dals over ex­chang­ing sex­u­ally ex­plicit text mes­sages with a string of women. 
He sep­a­rated from Miss Abe­din, vice chair­man of the Clin­ton cam­paign, in Au­gust. 
It is un­der­stood the FBI is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Weiner af­ter it was re­vealed that he had been sex­ting a high school stu­dent who was 15 at the time. Mr Trump re­acted with de­light to Mrs Clin­ton’s 11th-hour elec­tion night­mare. 
Ad­dress­ing a ju­bi­lant crowd in New Hamp­shire, Trump said: ‘Hil­lary Clin­ton’s cor­rup­tion is on a scale we’ve never seen be­fore. We must not let her take her crim­i­nal scheme into the Oval Of­fice.’ Mr Trump had pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised the FBI and Depart­ment of Jus­tice for not bring­ing charges against his elec­tion opponent. His run­ning mate, Mike Pence, called on the FBI to im­me­di­ately re­lease all the emails per­ti­nent to the investigation, adding: ‘The Amer­i­can peo­ple have a right to know.’ The Repub­li­can vice pres­i­den­tial can­di­date told a rally in Penn­syl­va­nia, that he and Don­ald Trump ‘com­mend the FBI for hav­ing the courage to re­open the case’. Chants of ‘Lock her up!’ came even be­fore Mr Pence ref­er­enced the FBI investigation. Mrs Clin­ton ig­nored shouted ques­tions from re­porters about the new FBI investigation as she walked off her plane in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most se­nior Repub­li­can in Congress, said she had be­trayed Amer­i­cans’ trust for han­dling ‘the na­tion’s most im­por­tant secrets. HOT NEWS!

It was somewhat of a social norm and no one seemed to care why because it was so popular; however, I believe it is a clear representation of the social and academic pressures imposed on children to be “successful.”
It also begs the question: How are so many kids gaining access to Adderall? Author and journalist Alan Schwarz explains that American children are not only severely over-diagnosed with A.D.H.D., but also frighteningly under-educated on the drugs they’re being prescribed, so they end up selling the pills instead of taking them. Well-known for his investigative reporting on how Big Pharma manufactured the “A.D.H.D. Nation” through advertising and doctor bribery, Schwarz recently published his book A.D.H.D. Nation using a term he coined to describe the widespread mishandling and misdiagnosis of the disorder.
How A.D.H.D. Became An Over-Diagnosed Disorder According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 11% of children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with A.D.H.D. as of 2011. However, if you ask the American Psychiatric Association, they maintain that even though only 5% of American children suffer from the disorder, the diagnosis is actually given to around 15% of American children. This number has been steadily rising , jumping from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2007. Schwarz identifies two main themes involved with A.D.H.D. misdiagnosis: the pharmaceutical industry’s role in pushing A.D.H.D. drugs, and doctors failing to identify the root cause of children’s behavioural issues.
In an interview with Scientific American , Schwarz explains: “Many kids have problems and need help—but those problems in many cases will derive from trauma, anxiety, family discord, poor sleep or diet, bullying at school and more. We must not abandon them. We must help. But we must also be more judicious in how we do that, rather than reflexively giving them a diagnosis of what is generally described as a serious, lifelong brain disorder.”
Big Pharma’s Role in Widespread A.D.H.D. Misdiagnosis It’s no secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry. As with many other diseases and disorders, when it comes to A.D.H.D., pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to overstate the dangers of A.D.H.D. and the benefits of taking their drugs and understate the negative side effects. It’s easy for people to believe this misguided information when it’s affiliated with well-known universities like Harvard and Johns Hopkins. Many people don’t even realize that these studies are funded by the very companies that profit from the drugs’ sale because that relationship is hidden in small print ( source ). Even though many of the advertisements Big Pharma has released state that A.D.H.D. medication is “ safer than aspirin ,” these drugs can have significant side effects and are actually considered to be within the same class as morphine and oxycodone due to high risk of abuse and addiction. You can’t just blame all doctors, either; many of them genuinely believe they’re helping these children because of the information they’ve been given in these studies and by Big Pharma.
Big Pharma creates advertisements for A.D.H.D. drugs that are specifically targeted at parents, describing how these drugs can improve test scores and behaviour at home, among other false claims. One of the most controversial ones was a 2009 ad for Intuniv, Shire’s A.D.H.D. treatment, which included a child in a monster costume taking off his terrifying mask to reveal his calm, smiling self with a text reading, “There’s a great kid in there.” The FDA has stepped in multiple times, sending pharmaceutical companies warning letters or even forcing them to take down their ads because they are false, misleading, and/or exaggerate the effects of their drugs ( source ).
The following New York Times video was created by Schwarz and Poh Si Teng:

What Is A.D.H.D. and Is It Even Real? If brain scans are performed on people with A.D.H.D., there are clear structural differences; however, the majority of A.D.H.D. diagnoses are confirmed by observation, and often not even by a doctor. Parents or school teachers are typically responsible for observing a child’s actions, and if they fit the “criteria” for A.D.H.D., doctors confirm the diagnosis and hand them a prescription. Instead of getting to the root of these children’s “attention deficit,” they are told they have a medical condition that can only be fixed with medication. This is not only unethical, but also clearly damaging to a child’s self esteem. Many of these kids could simply be uninterested in the subject matter, suffering from some sort of emotional trauma, or even have heightened creativity and energy!
Many doctors question the legitimacy of A.D.H.D. in general and whether or not it should be classified as a mental disorder. This is largely because the definition of this and similar disorders is usually heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. American psychologist Lisa Cosgrove and others investigated financial ties between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) panel members and the pharmaceutical industry. Their findings showed that, of the 170 DSM panel members, 95 (56%) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry and 100% of the members of the panels on ‘mood disorders’ and ‘schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders’ had financial ties to drug companies (read our article about it here ).
Neurologist Richard Saul spent his career examining patients who struggle with short attention spans and difficulty focusing. His extensive experience has led him to believe that A.D.H.D. isn’t actually a disorder, but rather an umbrella of symptoms that shouldn’t be considered a disease. Thus, Saul believes it shouldn’t be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual. You can read more about his opinion in our article here .
No matter what your stance on A.D.H.D. is, it is clear that too many children are being diagnosed with it and handed prescriptions without proper medical evaluations. If you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., I suggest you do your own research on the subject instead of simply taking drugs for a “mental disorder” that may have been falsely diagnosed.

"title: NYC Democratic Election Commissioner: “They Bus People Around to Vote” author: The European Union Times text: 
In a video released by Project Veritas, James Oâ€™Keefe exposes what everyone except Democrats have known to be true. There is a lot of voter fraud.
In the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.
â€œYeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,â€ said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.
Voter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyoneâ€™s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.
â€œYou know, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an IDâ€ŚLike I say, people donâ€™t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,â€ said Schulkin.
When asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, â€œthey get busses and they move people around.â€
Schulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.
â€œHe gave out ID cards. De Blasio. Thatâ€™s in lieu of a driverâ€™s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didnâ€™t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. Itâ€™s absurd. Thereâ€™s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.â€
Despite having disapproval with de Blasioâ€™s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.
â€œThey detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole electionâ€ŚYour vote doesnâ€™t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you donâ€™t know if they are a voter.â€
It is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.

"title: Заседание Международного дискуссионного клуба «Валдай», Владимир В. Путин author: Владимир В. Путин text: Заседание Международного дискуссионного клуба «Валдай» Владимир В. Путин Сеть Вольтер | Сочи (Россия) | 27 октября 2016 English français Т.Колтон (как переведено): Добрый день, дамы и господа! Меня зовут Тимоти Колтон. Я знаком со многими присутствующими сегодня здесь. Мне чрезвычайно приятно, что меня попросили выступить модератором этой последней сессии в 2016 году в рамках Валдайского дискуссионного клуба, так мы его называем.
Хотел бы особо приветствовать нашего основного выступающего – это Владимир Владимирович Путин, Президент Российской Федерации. Он нашёл время, чтобы приехать сюда, принять участие. Мы знаем, как он занят. Мы также высоко ценим его готовность отвечать на наши вопросы.
В какой‑то момент, когда Вы выйдете на пенсию, господин Президент, и напишете свои мемуары, попытайтесь подумать, сколько времени Вы потратили на ответы и вопросы. Я уверен, Вы будете поражены этим. Мы очень благодарим Вас за это. Спасибо за то, что Вы с нами сегодня.
Позвольте мне также представить других участников сегодняшней сессии. Я представлю их в том порядке, в котором они будут выступать. Прежде всего Тарья Халонен, которая сидит справа от господина Президента. У неё была блестящая карьера, в течение 12 лет она была президентом соседа Российской Федерации – Финляндской Республики, до 2012 года. Затем выступит господин Хайнц Фишер, который сидит слева от Президента Путина. У него также очень длинная, разнообразная карьера. Совсем недавно он вышел в отставку с поста президента Австрийской Республики, он занимал этот пост с 2004 года до 2016 года. Сейчас в Австрии нет президента, к сожалению, но это уже другая история.
Третий выступающий, я хотел бы представить его, господин Табо Мбеки, ещё один человек с длительной карьерой. С 1999 года по 2008 год он занимал пост президента Южно-Африканской Республики.
Я не думаю, что я должен представлять Андрея Быстрицкого. Он активно участвует в наших встречах, но он всё‑таки коротко остановится на встрече Валдайского клуба здесь. Он возглавляет Совет, занимающийся Валдайским форумом.
Пожалуйста, Андрей, слово Вам.
А.Быстрицкий: Спасибо большое.
Уважаемый господин Президент! Уважаемые гости и модератор! Уважаемые участники Валдайского форума!
Мы собрались на заключительное пленарное заседание нашей ежегодной большой Валдайской конференции. За три дня работы, как мне представляется, мы проделали большой путь. И, как мне кажется, эта конференция была исключительно интересной. Мы обсуждали, что уже сегодня определяет завтра, наше будущее. В общем, мы сконцентрировались примерно на пяти сферах современной жизни, положение дел в которых, мы видим, это будущее и определяет.
Это международные отношения, это экономика, это демография и миграция, это технологии и общественное устройство. Эти сферы важны по очевидным причинам. От международных отношений в прямом смысле зависят вопросы войны и мира, от экономики – общая возможность развития человечества. Демографические и миграционные проблемы способны поколебать стабильность очень многих стран. А технологии в состоянии изменить все наши представления о том, что возможно и что невозможно в этом мире.
И наконец, внутреннее устройство страны, оно, впрочем, как и всегда, но сейчас в иной форме влияет в том числе и на внешнюю политику этих стран. И, в общем, конференция прояснила много вопросов, впрочем, поставила и много новых. С одной стороны, вроде бы все сошлись на том, что современный мир немыслим без международных институтов и международного права, хотя их нынешнее состояние представляется не идеальным и мир нуждается как в развитии, так и в улучшении уже действующих, а может быть, и создании чего‑то нового и дополнительного.
Естественно, интересно и то, что, обсуждая противоречия, которые естественным образом возникают между крупными мировыми игроками, большинство сошлось на том, что эти противоречия всё же не являются непреодолимыми, что шанс, хотя и не безусловный, преодолеть их и договориться есть. Любопытно, но многие ответили, что при сохранении по‑прежнему важной роли США влияние многих государств, прежде всего таких, как Китай, Индия, Россия, растёт, а о Западной Европе так сказать нельзя, при всей экономической мощи в политическом отношении её возможности и активность представляются недостаточными. Более того, возможно, они уменьшаются в сравнении с растущей Азией и Россией.
Обсуждались и те сферы, которые если и зависимы от политики властей, то не прямо, это уже упомянутые технологии и миграции, например. В ходе дискуссии о миграции, которая называлась «Мир после переселения народов», прозвучала мысль о том, что правильнее назвать не «мир после», а «мир до переселения народов», поскольку, возможно, главные миграционные волны и самые главные угрозы ещё впереди.
О технологиях тоже было сказано немало, и хотя сегодня мы понимаем их возрастающую мощь и даже видим отдельные серьёзные последствия, но всё же сколько‑нибудь полного понимания о масштабах и влиянии и долгосрочных последствиях у нас нет. Отчасти вследствие этого, мы сегодня об этом говорили, Валдайский клуб совместно с Всероссийским центром изучения общественного мнения попытается с помощью нового, нами разрабатываемого индекса измерить уровень готовности стран к будущему.
Кроме того, чрезвычайно интересными были две специальные сессии: по Ближнему Востоку и по Европе. Высказывались весьма разные точки зрения, подчас полярные.
Также мне кажется, что очень интересно прошли встречи с Игорем Ивановичем Шуваловым, с Вячеславом Викторовичем Володиным, с Сергеем Викторовичем Лавровым, Алексеем Леонидовичем Кудриным. Здесь у нас принимала участие Элла Александровна Памфилова в дискуссиях и многие, многие другие очень известные российские и не только российские учёные, деятели и так далее.
В общем, конечно, рассказать в три минуты о том, что было в три дня, невозможно. Но мы, как всегда, подготовим доклад по итогам Валдайского клуба и, естественно, представим его вашему взыскательному вниманию.
Спасибо большое.
Т.Колтон: Очень хорошо.
А теперь давайте перейдём к делам. У нас потрясающая тема: как вы видите эту философию международного развития в интересах нового мира? И это вызывает в памяти серьёзные вопросы, которые, на мой взгляд, могут дать нам возможность двигаться в разных направлениях, послушать разнообразные комментарии, различные точки зрения.
Философия – это очень требовательное слово, однако, когда речь идёт о международном развитии, я думаю, что это подходящее слово. Вчера я провёл поиск Google и использовал слова «международное развитие», «философия». Результатов было 13 миллионов. Так что очень много слов потрачено на описание этой темы. Однако она настолько сложна, настолько многоаспектна, что есть элементы, заслуживающие дополнительного исследования, в особенности в свете того, что мы видим в интернете, в газетах, где заголовки в основном касаются вопросов конфликтов, безопасности и так далее.
Так что очень просто забыть о повестке дня в области развития, а она между тем очень масштабна, она преображает наш мир. Удивительно, каким образом эти компоненты складываются воедино, как они отражаются на нашей парадигме развития. Если раньше это был вашингтонский консенсус, сейчас он подвергается нападкам со всех сторон.
Очень удивительно смотреть на то, что происходит с официальной помощью развитию, это особый компонент развития. Совсем недавно такая помощь в основном доминировала ограниченным числом стран, это богатые страны, которые имеют развитую промышленную систему и выделяли основную часть помощи. Сейчас же появились новые доноры, которые ранее были реципиентами помощи.
Такие, например, как страны БРИКС, в том числе Южная Африка, Южная Корея, Саудовская Аравия, Турция, Венесуэла, Чили, Таиланд. Усложняется ситуация ещё и тем, что многие из этих доноров новых по‑прежнему остаются и реципиентами помощи, то есть категория получателя помощи и выделителя её несколько размыта.
А сейчас я передаю слово Президенту Путину. Пожалуйста.
В.Путин: Уважаемые Тарья, Хайнц, Табо! Уважаемые коллеги, дамы и господа!
Я тоже очень рад нашей новой встрече. И хочу прежде всего поблагодарить российских и зарубежных участников Международного клуба «Валдай» за содержательное участие в его работе, а наших уважаемых гостей – за готовность принять участие в открытой дискуссии.
Наш уважаемый модератор пожелал мне благополучно выйти на пенсию, я тоже себе этого желаю, когда время придёт, это очень правильно, это нужно сделать. Но пока я ещё не на пенсии, действующий руководитель большой державы, я должен быть сдержанным, не проявлять в своих выражениях излишней агрессивности. Собственно говоря, я и не думаю, что это мой стиль.
Тем не менее полагаю, что особенно в этой аудитории мы должны быть откровенны друг с другом, должны вести открытую дискуссию, иначе она не имеет смысла, она будет постной и абсолютно неинтересной.
Такой стиль нашего общения, действительно, на мой взгляд, сегодня чрезвычайно востребован, потому что на фоне масштабных перемен, которые происходят на планете, тема нынешнего заседания «Валдая» – «Будущее начинается сегодня: контуры завтрашнего мира» – звучит очень актуально.
В прошлом году в рамках Валдайского форума мы говорили о неустроенности миропорядка. К сожалению, за прошедшие месяцы к лучшему мало что изменилось, если быть откровенным – ничего к лучшему не изменилось.
Противоречия, связанные с перераспределением экономической мощи и политического влияния, только нарастают, груз взаимного недоверия сужает наши возможности для того, чтобы эффективно отвечать на стоящие перед мировым сообществом реальные вызовы и реальные угрозы. По сути в кризисе оказался сам проект глобализации, а в Европе говорят уже – мы это хорошо знаем, слышим – о несостоятельности мультикультурализма.
Считаю, что такая ситуация – во многом следствие ошибочного, поспешного, а в чём‑то и самоуверенного выбора, сделанного элитами некоторых государств четверть века назад. Тогда, на рубеже 80 – 90-х годов, был шанс не просто ускорить процессы глобализации, а придать им качественно иной, гармоничный, устойчивый характер.
Однако, посчитав себя победителями в «холодной войне», – не посчитав, а мы слышали, прямо рассуждая об этом, некоторые страны предпочли просто начать «перелицовывать» мировой политический и экономический порядок под себя, под свои интересы.
Находясь в явной эйфории, они по сути отказались от содержательного, равноправного диалога с другими участниками международной жизни, предпочли не создавать и совершенствовать универсальные институты, а попытались распространить на весь мир действие своих собственных структур, норм и правил, пошли по пути глобализации и безопасности «для себя, любимых», для избранных, а не для всех. Оказалось, что далеко не все с этим согласны.
Что греха таить, мы с вами прекрасно знаем и понимаем: многие были не согласны, но кто‑то уже не мог этому противостоять, а кто‑то ещё не был к этому готов. Но в результате, тем не менее, систему международных отношений лихорадит, глобальная экономика не может выйти из системного кризиса. При этом принципы и правила – как в политике, так и в экономике – постоянно перетасовываются, зачастую выворачивается наизнанку то, что совсем недавно считалось истиной, возводилось в догму.
Если сегодня «сильным мира сего» выгодны какие‑то стандарты или нормы, они заставляют подчиняться им и всех остальных. Но если завтра такие стандарты начинают мешать, их немедленно отправляют «в корзину», объявляют устаревшими и устанавливают новые правила или пытаются это сделать.
Так было принято решение о нанесении ракетно-бомбовых ударов в центре Европы, по Белграду; по Ираку, затем по Ливии. Да и, собственно говоря, в Афганистане операция началась без соответствующего решения Совета Безопасности Организации Объединённых Наций. Стремясь изменить в свою пользу стратегический баланс, сломали и международно-правовой режим, запрещавший развёртывание новых систем противоракетной обороны. Создали и накачали оружием террористические группировки, жестокость которых толкает миллионы мирных людей к бегству, переселению, миграции, а целые регионы ввергает в хаос.
Мы видим, как жертвуют свободой торговли и используют так называемые санкции для политического давления, в обход Всемирной торговой организации пытаются формировать закрытые экономические альянсы с жёсткими правилами и барьерами, где главные выгодоприобретатели – свои транснациональные корпорации. Почему это происходит, мы тоже знаем: не удаётся решить в рамках ВТО накопившиеся проблемы, значит, в стороночку отодвинем все эти правила и саму организацию и создадим новую. Это именно то, о чём я только что сказал.
При этом мы не видим желания некоторых наших партнёров решать реальные международные проблемы. В созданных ещё во время «холодной войны» и явно переживших свой век структурах, таких, например, как НАТО, несмотря на все разговоры о необходимости адаптации к новым условиям никакой реальной адаптации к новым условиям не происходит. А такой важный механизм обеспечения общеевропейской, да и трансатлантической безопасности, как ОБСЕ, постоянно пытаются превратить в инструмент обслуживания чьих‑то внешнеполитических интересов. И в результате этот важнейший инструмент работает вхолостую.
При этом постоянно штампуются угрозы – вымышленные, мифические, вроде пресловутой «российской военной угрозы». Действительно, это прибыльное занятие: можно новые военные бюджеты выбивать в своих собственных странах, нагибать союзников под интересы одной сверхдержавы, расширить НАТО, приблизить инфраструктуру альянса, боевые подразделения, новую технику к нашим границам.
Конечно, очень приятно, подчас и выгодно, выдавать себя за защитников цивилизации от каких‑то новых варваров. Однако дело в том, что Россия‑то ни на кого нападать не собирается. Да и смешно это: я ведь тоже читаю и ваши аналитические материалы, не только присутствующих здесь в зале, но и аналитиков из тех же Соединённых Штатов, из Европы.
Немыслимо просто, глупо и нереалистично. В одной Европе – 300 миллионов, все члены НАТО; с США общая численность населения – 600 миллионов человек, наверно. В России 146 миллионов всего сейчас. Просто смешно даже об этом говорить. Нет, это всё равно используется для достижения своих политических целей.
К числу мифических, придуманных проблем относится и развёрнутая в США истерия, по‑другому не могу сказать, по поводу влияния России на ход нынешних выборов американского Президента. Казалось бы, в Америке действительно множество острых, действительно насущных проблем – от колоссального государственного долга до роста насилия с применением огнестрельного оружия и фактов полицейского произвола.
И, наверное, в ходе выборов разговор должен был бы идти именно об этом, о других нерешённых проблемах. Но, видимо, сказать элите особенно нечего, нечем общество успокоить. Поэтому куда проще отвлечь внимание людей на российских так называемых хакеров, шпионов, агентов влияния и так далее, и тому подобное.
Хочу задаться вопросом и вам этот вопрос задать: неужели кто‑то всерьёз думает, что Россия может как‑то повлиять на выбор американского народа? Америка – это какая‑то «банановая страна», что ли? Америка – это великая держава. Если я не прав, поправьте меня, пожалуйста.
Возникает вопрос: если дальше всё будет развиваться в таком русле, что ждёт мир? Каким он будет завтра? Есть ли ответы на вопросы, как обеспечить стабильность, безопасность, устойчивость экономического роста? Как повысить благосостояние людей?
Как это ни печально признать, никакого консенсуса на этот счёт в мире нет. Не знаю, может быть, в ходе состоявшихся дискуссий вы пришли к такому общему выводу, мне было бы, конечно, интересно об этом услышать. Но существует, совершенно точно, дефицит стратегии и идеологии будущего. Это создаёт атмосферу неуверенности, которая прямо влияет на общественные настроения.
Социологические исследования, проводимые по всей планете, показывают, что жителям разных стран и континентов будущее, к огромному нашему сожалению, чаще всего кажется смутным и мрачным. Будущее не зовёт, оно пугает. При этом люди не видят реальных возможностей и механизмов что‑либо изменить, как‑то повлиять на ход событий, на выбор политики.
Да, формально все атрибуты демократии в современных странах налицо: выборы, свобода слова, доступ к информации, право выражать своё мнение. Однако даже в так называемых развитых демократиях у большинства граждан нет реального влияния на политические процессы, нет прямого, реального влияния на власть.
Граждане чувствуют, что их интересы и представления элит о единственно правильном курсе, который эти элиты выбирают, всё чаще и больше расходятся между собой. Как следствие – референдумы, выборы всё чаще преподносят сюрпризы, сюрпризы для власти. Люди голосуют совсем не так, как им советовали официальные, респектабельные средства массовой информации, и не так, как это рекомендуют так называемые системные партии. А общественные движения, которые ещё совсем недавно считались слишком «левыми» или слишком «правыми», выходят на авансцену, оттесняя политических тяжеловесов.
Сперва такие неудобные результаты поспешили объявить некой аномалией, случайностью. Когда они стали повторяться, заговорили о том, что общество не понимает тех, кто находится на олимпе власти, не доросло до того, чтобы оценить устремления властных структур, заботу о народном благе, а то и вовсе доходят до истерики, мол, это следствие зарубежной, как правило, российской пропаганды.
Я вам скажу, уважаемые друзья и коллеги, хотелось бы мне иметь такую пропагандистскую машину в России, но это, к сожалению, не так. У нас нет таких глобальных средств массовой информации, как CNN, BBC и некоторые другие, у нас таких возможностей пока нет.
Что касается тезиса о торжестве маргиналов, популистов над здравомыслящим, трезвым, ответственным меньшинством, то дело, конечно, и не в популистах и иже с ними, а дело в том, что простые люди, рядовые граждане перестают доверять правящему классу, вот в чём проблема.
Кстати, политическая повестка и так уже выхолощена, выборы перестают быть инструментом перемен, а сводятся к скандалам, обсуждению компроматов. Простите меня, к обсуждению того, кто кого за что ущипнул, кто с кем спит. Это просто переходит всякие границы. Да и, честно говоря, если посмотреть на программы различных кандидатов, то такое впечатление, что они вообще скроены по одним и тем же лекалам, разница‑то небольшая или её вообще, по сути, нет.
Элита словно не замечает углубляющегося расслоения в обществе и размывания среднего класса, и при этом насаждают идеологические модели, которые, на мой взгляд, разрушают культурную, национальную идентичность. А в некоторых случаях, в некоторых странах и жертвуют национальными интересами, отказываются от суверенитета в обмен на благосклонность сюзерена.
Резонно возникает вопрос: так кто же, в самом деле, маргинален? Расширяющийся класс наднациональной олигархии и бюрократии, часто фактически не избираемый и не контролируемый обществом, или большинство граждан, которое хочет, в общем‑то, простых и понятных вещей: стабильности, свободного развития своих стран, жизненных перспектив для себя и своих детей, сохранения своего культурного лица, а главное, элементарной безопасности для себя и своих близких.
Так, люди откровенно напуганы тем, что на их глазах терроризм из какой‑то далёкой угрозы стал повседневностью, что теракт может произойти буквально рядом, на соседней улице, если не на собственной улице, а орудием массового убийства способно стать любое подручное средство: от изготовленной кустарным способом взрывчатки до обычного грузовика.
Более того, теракты последних лет в Бостоне, других американских городах, в Париже, Брюсселе, Ницце, в городах ФРГ, да, к сожалению, в нашей стране, показывают, что террористам уже не нужны ни ячейки, ни организационные структуры, они могут действовать и в одиночку, автономно, достаточно лишь идеологически их мотивировать и направить на врага, на нас с вами.
На примере террористической опасности со всей очевидностью проявляется неспособность оценить характер, причины возникновения нарастания угроз. Мы видим это по тому, как развивается ситуация в Сирии. Остановить кровопролитие и запустить политический процесс не удаётся. Казалось бы, после долгих переговоров, огромных усилий и сложных компромиссов наконец начал формироваться единый фронт борьбы с терроризмом.
Однако этого не произошло, он фактически не создан. Не сработали и наши личные договорённости с Президентом Соединённых Штатов, в Вашингтоне нашлись силы, которые сделали всё, чтобы эти договорённости не были реализованы на практике. Всё это демонстрирует необъяснимое, я бы сказал, иррациональное стремление западных стран раз за разом повторять свои ошибки, как у нас в народе говорят, наступать на одни и те же грабли.
Все мы видим, что происходит в том же Афганистане, Ираке, Ливии, ряде других стран. Я задаюсь вопросом: где результаты борьбы с терроризмом и экстремизмом? По большому счёту, в глобальном масштабе, регионально где‑то, в отдельных местах результаты есть, но глобально результатов борьбы с терроризмом нет, а угрозы только нарастают.
Мы все помним эйфорию некоторых столиц по поводу так называемой «арабской весны». Где сегодня эти бравурные марши? А призывы России к совместной борьбе с террористами игнорируются. Более того, террористические группировки продолжают вооружать, снабжать, обучать в надежде использовать их, как и прежде, для достижения своих политических целей. Это очень опасная игра, и хочу ещё раз обратиться к подобным игрокам: в данном случае экстремисты хитрее, умнее и сильнее вас, и, заигрывая с ними, вы всегда будете проигрывать.
Уважаемые участники форума! Очевидно, что сейчас мировому сообществу важно сосредоточиться на действительно реальных проблемах, стоящих перед всем человечеством, решение которых позволит сделать мир и безопасным, и стабильным, а систему международных отношений равноправной и справедливой. И, как уже говорил, в конечном счёте превратить глобализацию из глобализации для избранных в глобализацию для всех. Убеждён, любые вызовы и угрозы можно преодолеть только сообща, на прочной основе международного права и Устава Организации Объединённых Наций.
Сегодня именно ООН продолжает оставаться структурой, которой нет равных по представительности и универсальности, уникальной площадкой для равноправного диалога. Универсальные правила ООН необходимы, чтобы включить как можно большее число стран в процесс экономической и гуманитарной интеграции, гарантировать их политическую ответственность и обеспечить согласованность действий, разумеется, при сохранении суверенитета и своей модели развития.
У нас нет сомнения, суверенитет – это центральное понятие всей системы международных отношений. Его уважение, укрепление – это залог мира, стабильности и на национальном, и на международном уровне. Стран, которые, как Россия, могут опереться на тысячелетнюю историю, в мире немало, и мы научились ценить свою идентичность, свободу и независимость. При этом мы не стремимся ни к глобальному доминированию, ни к экспансии какой‑то, ни к конфронтации с кем бы то ни было.
В нашем понимании настоящее лидерство сегодня заключается не в том, чтобы выдумывать эфемерные угрозы и, спекулируя на них, пытаться подмять под себя остальных, а в том, чтобы видеть реальные проблемы, содействовать объединению усилий государств в их решении. И именно так Россия понимает сегодня свою роль в мировых делах.
Приоритеты, без которых благополучное будущее нашей общей планеты немыслимо, абсолютно очевидны. Не скажу ничего нового. Прежде всего это равная и неделимая безопасность для всех государств. Только прекратив вооружённые конфликты и обеспечив мирное развитие всех стран, мы сможем говорить об экономическом прогрессе, решении социальных, гуманитарных и других ключевых проблем. Важно на деле бороться с терроризмом и экстремизмом. Уже не раз говорилось о том, что победить это зло можно, только объединив усилия всех государств мира. Россия предлагала и предлагает до сих пор это всем заинтересованным нашим партнёрам.
Необходимо поставить в международную повестку и вопрос о восстановлении прочной государственности, экономики и социальной сферы стран Ближнего Востока. Колоссальный масштаб разрушений требует сегодня выработки долгосрочной и комплексной программы, если хотите, своего рода «план Маршалла» для возрождения этого истерзанного войнами и конфликтами региона. И Россия, конечно, готова принять активное участие в такой совместной работе.
Мир нельзя сделать стабильным, если не обеспечить поступательное развитие глобальной экономики. Важно создать условия для созидательного труда и экономического роста, обеспечить темпы экономического роста так, чтобы мир не был больше разделён на вечно проигрывающих и вечно выигрывающих. Правила игры должны быть такими, чтобы развивающиеся экономики имели шанс хотя бы догнать тех, кого мы называем экономиками развитыми. Нужно добиваться выравнивания темпов экономического развития, подтягивать отстающие страны и регионы, чтобы плоды экономического роста и технологического развития были доступны всем, в том числе это позволит победить одну из самых тяжелейших проблем современности – бедность.
Абсолютно очевидно и то, что экономическое сотрудничество должно быть взаимовыгодным и базироваться на всеобщих универсальных принципах, чтобы каждое государство могло стать равноправным участником мировой хозяйственной жизни. Да, в среднесрочной перспективе тенденция на регионализацию мировой экономики, видимо, продолжится, но региональные торговые соглашения должны дополнять, развивать, а не подменять универсальные нормы и правила.
Россия выступает за гармонизацию региональных экономических форматов на основе принципов прозрачности и уважения интересов друг друга. Именно так мы выстраиваем деятельность Евразийского экономического союза, ведём переговоры с нашими партнёрами, в том числе о сопряжении с реализуемым Китаем проектом «Экономического пояса Шёлкового пути». Рассчитываем, что это позволит создать большое Евразийское партнёрство, которое в перспективе может превратиться и в один из центров формирования в Евразии широкого интеграционного контура. Для воплощения этой идеи уже начаты переговоры в формате «пять плюс один» по соглашению о торгово-экономическом сотрудничестве между всеми участниками этого процесса.
Важная задача – это развитие человеческого потенциала. Только мир с широкими возможностями для всех, с высококвалифицированными работниками, доступными знаниями, богатством путей самореализации может считаться по‑настоящему свободным. Только мир, в котором люди разных стран живут полноценной жизнью, а не борются за выживание, может быть стабильным.
Достойное будущее невозможно без заботы об экологии, конечно, и решения климатических проблем. Поэтому сохранение природного богатства и его многообразия, снижение антропогенной нагрузки на окружающую среду в ближайшие десятилетия станут всё более значимым делом.
Не менее важна и задача глобальной охраны здоровья. Безусловно, здесь немало проблем с масштабными эпидемиями, снижением смертности в ряде регионов мира и множество, множество других. Здесь же огромное поле для развития, конечно. Дать жителям планеты, причём всем опять же, а не избранным, возможность по‑настоящему здоровой, долгой, полноценной жизни – это очень благородная цель. Словом, фундамент для будущего мира нужно, безусловно, искать уже сегодня, вкладывая средства во все приоритетные направления развития человечества. И конечно, важно, чтобы контуры нашего общего будущего широко обсуждались, чтобы все здравые, перспективные предложения были услышаны.
Уважаемые коллеги, дамы и господа! Не сомневаюсь, что в этой работе вы – члены Валдайского клуба – примете самое активное участие. Ваш высокий экспертный потенциал, уровень позволяет всесторонне оценить процессы, происходящие и в России у нас, и в мире, увидеть, спрогнозировать развитие долгосрочных тенденций, дать им оценки, идеи подтолкнуть новые и рекомендации предоставить, которые помогут нам найти путь к более благополучному и более стабильному будущему, в котором мы все так нуждаемся.
Спасибо вам большое за внимание!
Т.Колтон: Спасибо большое, господин Путин.
А сейчас хотел бы предоставить слово госпоже Халонен. Она так же, как я понимаю, выступит от трибуны.
Т.Халонен (как переведено): Господин Президент! Ваши превосходительства! Дамы и господа! Уважаемые участники!
Большое спасибо за организацию Валдайского клуба, спасибо, что пригласили меня поучаствовать в этих обсуждениях. Тема очень интересная, своевременная, как было уже отмечено. И мы видим новую динамику, которая влияет на всех нас, на глобальный мировой порядок, на региональные дела. Я очень рада тому, что мои коллеги, мои хорошие друзья – бывший президент Австрийской Республики господин Фишер, а также господин Путин – со мной сегодня разделяют трибуну. Мы сотрудничали на протяжении последних десятилетий вместе, и мы разделяем многие идеи о том, как мы бы хотели, чтобы мир развивался в будущем. Поэтому я думаю, что обсуждения будут очень открытыми, откровенными.
Философия международного развития для нового мира используется в заголовке наших обсуждений, и она напоминает мне о тех годах Горбачёва, говорившего о новом мировом порядке. Новый мировой порядок произошёл частично, как предусматривалось, а частично не так, как предусматривалось. И я не уверена, можем ли мы говорить действительно о порядке. Конечно же, мы приветствуем оптимизм, мы многого добились, мир действительно изменился. Тем не менее, думаю, не все понимают, что мир будет состоять из многих игроков. И что это значит, когда у нас так много игроков одновременно?
Коллективные глобальные действия сталкиваются со многими сложностями, в частности в сфере глобальной политики безопасности. Таким образом, люди говорят, что изменения всегда представляют собой возможность. Но сегодня, несмотря на усилия, направленные на стабилизацию международных отношений, глобальной экономики и благосостояния, как уже сказал Президент Путин, у нас есть проблема того, как справляться с кризисами.
И действительно, очень много вызовов и проблем стоит перед нами. Что же я наблюдала во время участия в различных форумах за последние годы, особенно во время своего президентства? Люди всегда говорят, что этот мир – это мир полной неопределённости. Это действительно так. Люди чувствуют каждый день, что они очень сомневаются в будущем, и иногда это очень парадоксально, поскольку мы настолько продвинулись вперёд.
В любом случае это мир, в котором мы живём, мир, в котором нам нужно строить фундамент для устойчивого будущего, и если мы будем ждать, лучше не станет, и мы должны быть в состоянии работать на различных фронтах. И хотя, к сожалению, конфликты по‑прежнему имеют место и становятся всё более гибридными по своей природе, нам нужно понимать, что представляет собой устойчивое развитие. Возможно, нам уже известно, каким может быть порядок в будущем. Конечно, СМИ всегда заинтересованы в освещении конфликтов, но хочу рассказать вам о том, что будет в будущем.
Повестка, принятая Организацией Объединённых Наций в сентябре 2015 года до 2030 года, представляет собой мощную основу для дальнейшей работы. И именно Организация Объединённых Наций объединила все крупные державы, основных игроков, и мы добились успеха. Мне очень приятно сознавать, что борьба с нищетой и неравенством является центральным элементом этой повестки дня, в особенности неравенство гендерное.
С момента саммита в Рио, думаю, что мы все заявили о том, что мы слишком сильно используем свои природные ресурсы. Однако, к сожалению, мы недостаточно использовали человеческий потенциал, в особенности потенциал женщин, бедного населения, а также молодых людей. И когда я смотрю на этот зал, я вижу, что многое уже меняется.
Очень серьёзная политическая воля была проявлена в 2015 году. Однако сейчас необходимо сдержать сделанные обещания, лидеры должны будут сделать то, что они взяли на себя в качестве ответственности. У нас есть ресурсы, у нас есть необходимые научные знания. Стоит вопрос о политической воле. Во‑первых, это морально необходимо и абсолютно нужно. Более того, речь идёт о создании интеллектуальной экономики, о правильном, умном выборе, и я уверена, что мы сможем добиться успеха.
Организация Объединённых Наций традиционно базировалась на трёх основах. Во‑первых, на безопасности, правах человека и развитии. Что касается развития и прав человека, мне кажется, что удалось на историческом отрезке добиться серьёзного успеха. К сожалению, конфликты по‑прежнему очень ожесточённые, полны насилия, они стали куда сильнее и куда более многочисленными, нежели мы надеялись бы. Однако, как я сказала, к несчастью, не закончился период катастроф и проблем.
Традиционные угрозы, может быть, становятся реже, однако вооружённые конфликты поражают многие страны. Гражданское общество, женщины и дети являются целью таких конфликтов, к сожалению. Я считаю, что это трагедия. Я работала с организациями системы ООН, с различными группами для того, чтобы способствовать благополучию, здоровью, безопасности женщин и детей. Ужасно видеть то, что происходит в Сирии, в Йемене, во многих других местах.
Однако давайте посмотрим на картину ещё с другой стороны. Очень грустно, мы видим, что военная сила, которая используется, может быть слишком сильной. И я должна сказать, что порой нам приходится пользоваться военной силой для того, чтобы положить конец насилию. Но каким образом? Мы не можем принять, чтобы люди страдали, гражданское население страдало, в особенности дети.
Более того, мы знаем, что в рамках глобализации всем хорошо известно, что происходит по всему миру. Так что мы в качестве населения реагируем на то, что происходит в других частях мира. Люди понимают, что справедливо, что хорошо, а что нет. И то, что хорошо, должно получать от нас поддержку. Такова основа моей философии.
Позвольте привести только один пример для того, чтобы завершить своё выступление. Я из Финляндии, из Хельсинки, из рабочего класса. В моей церкви 24 октября очень долго звонят колокола для того, чтобы помянуть жертв среди гражданского населения в Алеппо. Это гуманитарное движение распространилось по всей территории Финляндии, а сейчас перекинулось и на другие страны.
Церкви в Финляндии также стали прибежищем для тех, кто не получил статус беженца, но кто нуждается. Как вы видите, люди прекрасно понимают, что правильно, а что нет во многих странах, и они все говорят, что необходимо положить конец насилию в Сирии, Йемене, других местах. Они говорят о том, что мы должны быть больше людьми, более человечными по отношению друг к другу.
Господин Президент, господин Путин! Я была обеспокоена Вашим выступлением, потому что Вы нарисовали такую мрачную картину будущего, однако в конце Вы сказали, что есть всё‑таки проблеск надежды и есть воля к сотрудничеству. И хочу сказать, даже когда самые обычные люди, рядовые граждане, которые живут в серьёзных, стеснённых условиях, они все хотят, чтобы у них была надежда в будущем. Нам необходимо работать вместе для того, чтобы эта надежда воплотилась в жизнь. И мне очень приятно будет продолжать дискуссию.
Спасибо Вам!
Т.Колтон: Спасибо. Я благодарю Вас. А сейчас слово предоставляется господину Хайнцу Фишеру.
Х.Фишер (как переведено): Господин Президент! Уважаемая аудитория! Ваши превосходительства! Дамы и господа!
Прежде всего хотел бы поблагодарить организаторов этой встречи за направленное нам приглашение принять участие в Валдайской конференции, которая посвящена обмену мнениями о проблемах, о шансах, изменениях в международных отношениях. В частности, она посвящена вопросу о будущем международных отношений.
На мой взгляд, каждый желает знать, насколько это только возможно, каково будет будущее – будущее отдельно взятой личности, политическое будущее, экономическое будущее и так далее. Однако никогда не может быть удовлетворительного ответа на этот вопрос, потому что будущее – это не только результат воли человека, его личности, это также ещё и продукт объективных факторов. Но этого недостаточно, это очень сложная смесь двух этих компонентов, двух элементов. Есть множество философских течений, которые пытаются объяснить соотношения в этой смеси. Есть много интереснейших книг, в которых выражается различный подход к тому, как мы должны смотреть на будущее. Есть два основных направления мысли.
Во‑первых, некоторые считают, что в начале цивилизации, на заре, был золотой век, рай, а затем люди из‑за своих грехов пали. И они всё падали и падали, это падение продолжалось на протяжении истории. Согласно другому подходу говорится, что сперва существовал хаос, все воевали против всех, право сильного господствовало, насилие царствовало. Затем сложилось рабовладельческое общество, феодальное общество, наконец, капиталистическое общество, и в конце концов настал последний этап, когда причины антагонизма, насилия остались позади. Мне кажется, что ни тот, ни другой подход не подходит нам.
Сам я родился ещё до Второй мировой войны. Я помню о последних днях этой войны, помню, в частности, о сложных, но многообещающих временах восстановления после войны. Проблеском надежды, положительной чертой послевоенного времени нашей эры было подписание в 1955 году Соглашения о восстановлении суверенного Австрийского государства. И говорилось тогда в этом договоре о выводе иностранных войск из нашей страны. Мы считали, что этот момент положит начало положительному периоду успеха не только для Австрии, но и для всей Западной Европы.
Однако, к сожалению, одна тень нависла над этим положительным развитием. А именно, разделение Европы в ходе «холодной войны», а также возникла угроза «горячей войны». На излёте 90-х годов пропало разделение Европы, которое было главной причиной напряжённости. В тот момент казалось, что будущее будет светлым, что международные отношения будут развиваться хорошо и поступательно. Однако вновь развитие пошло по другому направлению, надежды, чаяния не оправдались.
Можно даже сказать, что те возможности, которые возникли в тот момент, не были задействованы полностью. Вновь было продемонстрировано, что история, как я только что сказал, не представляет собой линейный процесс, она развивается волнами, она качается от прогресса к регрессу, есть положительные изменения, есть отрицательные изменения. Конечно, прогресс – разница от континента к континенту, вне зависимости от глобализации.
Хотел бы сконцентрировать своё внимание на Европе и на соседнем регионе. Я по‑прежнему убеждён, что проект европейского сотрудничества, который был закреплён в виде идей, лежащих в основе Европейского союза, по‑прежнему необходим, это такое предприятие, которое нам нужно. Более того, европейское сотрудничество будет оставаться важной целью, важным стратегическим элементом в обозримом будущем.
Отчасти это объясняется тем, что, как мы слышали на протяжении многих дискуссий, Европейский союз отчасти лишился слаженности и своей привлекательности. Объясняется это недостаточным уровнем финансовой и экономической координации. Существуют различные интересы между государствами-членами, эти интересы всё более и более проявляются, возникают проблемы, европейская солидарность не работает так, как она должна работать.
Я должен упомянуть проблему беженцев. Европейский союз на фоне этой проблемы продемонстрировал отчасти свою несостоятельность и отсутствие солидарности. Отношения между ЕС и Российской Федерацией также развивались не так, как мы на то надеялись 25 лет назад. Я знаю аргументы, приводимые обеими сторонами относительно того, кто или что ответственны за такое развитие событий. Однако сейчас мы говорим ведь не о прошлом, мы говорим о будущем. И та, и другая сторона должны продемонстрировать, что они осознают важность отношений друг с другом. Европейский союз, в частности, не должен упускать из виду тот факт, что на протяжении последнего века развивались отношения между Европой и Россией, и что Москва иначе смотрит на развитие НАТО, и точка зрения Москвы отличается от брюссельской или вашингтонской.
Россия же должна принимать к сведению, она должна учитывать то, что некоторые действия, связанные с использованием военной силы, не соответствуют международному праву, они вызывают раздражение европейской публики и отражаются на политике ЕС. В частности, последний пример тому – Крым.
Алеппо – это символ того, каким образом сложно провести грань между борьбой с террористами, с одной стороны, и бомбардировками ни в чём неповинного населения. Я очень внимательно сегодня утром слушал дискуссию. Есть очень много проблем, которые сопряжены с этим процессом. Война в Сирии длится уже дольше, нежели Первая мировая война, и длится дольше, нежели вторжение Гитлера в Советский Союз во время Второй мировой войны.
Это ужасная война уже унесла сотни тысяч человеческих жизней, и она привела к ухудшению отношений между теми странами, которые даже не имеют общей границы с Сирией. Доверие было подорвано. Более того, этот процесс сопряжён с всплеском терроризма. Более того, терроризм порождает страх, страх порождает агрессию, а агрессия ведёт к возникновению фанатизма, с одной стороны, жёсткого национализма, что ставит под угрозу мир и свободу.
То же самое, пусть и несколько в другом масштабе, мы наблюдаем на примере палестино-израильского конфликта. Кажется, что решение этого конфликта как никогда далеко. Совсем недавно я присутствовал на похоронах Шимона Переса в Иерусалиме. Даже в слове на этих похоронах говорилось о том, что мир должен быть достигнут. Шимон часто говорил: «Невозможно Израилю безопасно существовать без мира». Нынешнее же правительство Израиля концентрируется не на мире, а на безопасности. Они утверждают, что без безопасности не может быть мира. Однако безопасность не может пользоваться приоритетом перед миром, и тот и другой фактор, и то и другое условие должны быть воплощены в жизнь одновременно.
Дамы и господа, можно задаться вопросом: есть ли какие‑то положительные аспекты, есть ли какие‑то положительные возможности, таящиеся в будущем? Ответ – да. Соглашение между «пятёркой» и «пять плюс один» в формате с Ираном по иранской ядерной программе – это хороший пример успеха.
Ещё один пример успеха – это успешное подписание Парижского соглашения по изменению климата. Это первый положительный шаг, хотя многое ещё предстоит сделать для того, чтобы решить эту проблему в целом. Европейская интеграция как таковая, даже невзирая на ряд негативных тенденций, которых я только что коснулся, невзирая на решения, даже нерешительность в целом представляет собой историю успеха.
Я также возлагаю большие надежды на работу Организации Объединённых Наций. Очень часто ООН попадает под град критики, их обвиняют в бессилии, тем не менее ООН по‑прежнему остаётся важнейшим игроком в международных отношениях, а также нравственным авторитетом. Цели развития тысячелетия сыграли ключевую роль в сокращении крайней нищеты почти на 50 процентов. С тех пор удалось добиться снижения материнской смертности, детской смертности на 45 процентов и на 50 процентов соответственно. Была принята новая повестка дня – развитие до 2030 года. В рамках этой повестки дня поставлены цели – продолжить этот прогресс, были сформулированы реалистичные, важные цели.
Дамы и господа! Даже несмотря на то, что невозможно в количественных показателях измерить развитие демократии, я убеждён, что демократия в качестве политической системы, ограничивающей власть тех, кто находится у кормила, наблюдается. Более того, мирный переход к демократии будет становиться всё более и более распространённым. То же самое касается прав человека, а также растущего уважения к правам человека.
Всё шире и шире наблюдается признание этого показателя в качестве показателя эффективного управления. Более того, я считаю, что демократия должна сыграть важную роль в наших обсуждениях о том, каким должно быть будущее. Это, в частности, касается следующего факта, это моё мнение. Демократическая система, а также готовность к миру, к избеганию войны в некотором смысле переплетены, взаимосвязаны.
Уважаемые гости! В футболе следующий матч всегда становится самым важным. Во внутренней политике следующие выборы всегда самые важные, а в международных отношениях следующие 10 лет – это самое важное время, а также самое сложное время одновременно. Однако кое‑что совершенно ясно, несомненно, история не носит линейного характера. Но поскольку историю творит человечество, мы несём на своих плечах ответственность за то, каким образом история будет развиваться на протяжении следующего десятилетия. Вот почему. Речь идёт о нашей коллективной ответственности. Мы должны поддерживать мир, пользоваться теми возможностями, которые нам предоставляются. Мы должны учиться на прошлых ошибках, а также стремиться к положительному развитию в будущем.
Я благодарю Вас за внимание.
Т.Колтон: Спасибо, господин Фишер. Господин Мбеки.
Т.Мбеки (как переведено): Большое спасибо, господин модератор!
Как и мои коллеги, хочу поблагодарить Валдайский дискуссионный клуб за приглашение поучаствовать.
Ваше превосходительство господин Президент Путин! Уважаемые панелисты! Уважаемые делегаты!
Я хотел бы верить в то, что вы поймёте, почему сегодня я выступаю перед вами, для того чтобы представить никем не санкционированное мнение Африканского континента о вопросах нашей повестки дня. Думаю, что все из нас вспомнят о Декларации тысячелетия ООН, которая была принята в 2000 году, где говорилось о целях развития тысячелетия, а также содержались глобальные обязательства, в частности, я цитирую: «Обеспечить специфические нужны Африки». И затем, в 2002 году, в сентябре, Генеральная Ассамблея ООН приняла Декларацию по новому партнёрству в целях развития Африки.
И затем в 2002 году, в сентябре, Генеральная Ассамблея ООН приняла Декларацию по новому партнёрству в целях развития Африки, и международная поддержка, реализация этого нового партнёрства в целях развития Африки крайне важна – это опять была цитата.
В октябре 2014 года Генеральный Секретарь ООН созвал совещание высокого уровня, перед которым была поставлена задача выработать рекомендации по операциям ООН сегодня и в будущем. В докладе этой группы, этой панели, содержалось следующее: в плане предотвращения конфликтов или реагирования на конфликты региональные партнёрства на Африканском континенте должны укрепляться.
И думаю, что для того чтобы понимать полностью важность этих рекомендаций, мы должны помнить о том, что в 2015 году 80 процентов миротворцев ООН были развёрнуты в Африке. И уважаемые коллеги заметили, что процитированные мною документы ООН, относящиеся к двум главным проблемам Африканского континента, – это социально-экономическое развитие, обеспечение мира и безопасности.
Я упомянул эти документы для того, чтобы обозначить главные проблемы, с которыми сталкивается Африканский континент, во‑первых.
Во‑вторых, обозначить, что эту реальность признаёт мировое сообщество.
И, в‑третьих, что международное сообщество принимает на себя обязательство вступить в партнёрство с Африкой для того, чтобы успешно справляться с этими проблемами.
Учитывая тему, выдвинутую на обсуждение, хотел бы сделать несколько высказываний о том, с какими проблемами сталкивается Африка, а также объём, в котором ООН реагирует на эти проблемы, также о философии развития.
В первую очередь хотел бы сказать в этой связи, что для того чтобы Африка добилась упомянутых мною целей, Африке необходим новый мир. Второе категоричное утверждение, которое я хочу сделать, – это то, что эти требования представляют собой категоричное противоречие тому, что Африканский континент является мировой периферией. И третье категоричное утверждение, которое я сделаю, заключается в том, что глобальное процветание и мир во всём мире недостижимы, в то время как Африка исключена и как участница таких прекрасных результатов. И четвёртое утверждение, которое я хотел бы сделать: поддержание мира и развитие невозможно без относительной автаркии в том, что относится к Африканскому континенту.
Что касается борьбы с бедностью и других целей – хотел бы подтвердить, что наш континент по‑прежнему с энтузиазмом относится к принятию очень амбициозных целей устойчивого развития, как уже упомянул наш президент. И это связано с теми глобальными обязательствами, поскольку для достижения целей устойчивого развития никто не останется позади – я опять упомянул цитату.
Для нас, африканцев, это означает, что система глобального правительства должна меняться таким образом, чтобы можно было достигнуть действительно цели устойчивого развития и тех целей, которые я обозначил. И в различные периоды времени существовали системы неравных правительств, в том числе в конце «холодной войны». Всё это привело к тому, что образовался однополярный мир, гегемония, с Соединёнными Штатами в качестве гегемона.
И в том, что касается африканского тысячелетия, как я упомянул, даже победа римлян над карфагенянами, колониализм, неоколониализм. Я хотел бы сказать, что существование гегемона приводит к возникновению феномена центра, который преуспевает за счёт существования периферии. И именно в плане глобального распределения у нас есть такая ситуация, когда, я думаю, что комментарий, который сделал господин Президент Путин сегодня днём, указывает на то, как существует сегодня этот мир.
Для Африки невозможно избавиться от существующей ситуации вне контекста мира, в котором бы уважалось равенство всех наций в плане определения миропорядка. И по этой причине как африканцы, и именно потому, что мы относительно слабы в глобальном плане – в экономическом, политическом, технологическом плане, – нам очень нужна свободная, универсально согласованная система международного права, которую будут уважать все страны.
И, на наш взгляд, какие бы легитимные предложения ни выдвигались в отношении создания лучшего мира, они должны быть основаны на той степени международного права, которая уже была согласована. И это подчёркивает абсолютный императив для всех наций вернуться к духу и букве для того, чтобы реализовать то, что было отражено в Уставе ООН и в других стратегических документах, которые были приняты после 1945 года в рамках ООН. Существование согласованного международного права, а также надежда на реформированные институты ООН должны быть центром философии международного развития для нового мира.
Большое спасибо.
Т.Колтон: Сейчас мы уже выслушали выступление всех четырёх ораторов. Мы начнём обсуждение довольно коротко, поскольку здесь так много желающих задать вопросы. Возможно, я начну с небольшим, коротким вопросом, и на него может ответить любой из присутствующих ораторов.
Во время комментариев Президента Путина меня удивил акцент на безопасности и отсутствии безопасности. И с дилеммой безопасности, с которой мы сталкиваемся, когда мы говорим о вопросах развития, я думаю, что это естественный способ, поскольку мы извлекли тот урок из истории, что без безопасности, предсказуемости развития не будет. Поэтому сейчас очень мучительный момент, когда развитие осуществляется.
Люди, которые живут в четырёх странах, представители которых сидят здесь, живут лучше, чем их предки, всё это происходит по всему миру, но отсутствие безопасности в мире тем не менее есть, и философ Гоббс говорил об этом, что это то состояние, при котором нет власти, приводит к отсутствию безопасности, нестабильности и неспособности отдельных людей обеспечить себе лучшую жизнь. И по всему миру происходил процесс строения государств, более сильных государств, и необходимо государствам учиться жить друг с другом в мире, в мирном сосуществовании.
Поэтому хотел бы задать очень общий вопрос нашим панелистам. Хотел бы спросить следующее. Во время выступлений каждого из вас вы все упоминали о том решении, которое предлагал Гоббс, – это построение институтов, изменение институтов. И хотел бы спросить вас, что должно быть нашим важнейшим приоритетом сейчас?
Президент Путин отметил в конце выступления важность ООН, важность того, чтобы ООН стала более эффективной, и использование ООН вместе с другими силами. Некоторые другие ораторы говорили о необходимости реформировать созданные институты. Например, господин Мбеки об этом упомянул. Наши европейские коллеги упоминали историю успеха, включая Европейский союз, например. ЕС появился достаточно недавно. Поэтому мой вопрос: что самое важное, о чём мы должны подумать сообща?
Мы должны создавать новые институты для вопросов безопасности или мы должны говорить о возвращении к тем институтам, которым сейчас уделяется меньше внимания, таким как ООН? Или мы должны в первую очередь концентрировать свои усилия на реформировании существующих институтов? А когда я говорю об институтах, я говорю прежде всего о международных институтах. Поэтому хотел бы сейчас предложить ораторам, может быть, начиная с Президента Путина, поделиться своим мнением, если у вас есть такое желание, конечно.
В.Путин: Просто полностью присоединяюсь к тому, что сказал Президент Табо Мбеки. Он сказал, я даже записал, процитирую: «Нужна система международного права, которая уважалась бы всеми странами». Нужно вернуться к Уставу Организации Объединённых Наций. Абсолютно правильно. И если бы он этого не сказал, я должен был бы сказать это сам. Я полностью разделяю эту точку зрения. Мы просто пренебрежительно начали относиться к Уставу ООН, вытесняя его при принятии очень важных решений, делая вид, что это уже не важно, устарело.
А потом, когда мир сталкивается с острыми проблемами, те, кто виноват в нарушении Устава Организации Объединённых Наций, резко начинают призывать к исполнению основных положений Устава ООН. Так нужно с самого начала, чтобы все это помнили и уважали Устав ООН. Нужна надёжная система международного права, которая была бы гарантией от любых злоупотреблений сил.
Т.Халонен: Думаю, что мы сейчас, на данный момент, создали государство наций. Мы знаем слабости государства наций, и нам нужно тем не менее развивать их сильные стороны. Я, поскольку сама из Финляндии, говорю о государстве благосостояния. Это демократия, это верховенство закона, это благосостояние, это социальные, экономические, культурные права народов, всех людей, также и мигрантов. И когда мы говорим о разнице между целями тысячелетия, целями устойчивого развития… Помню, когда я была сопредседателем на саммите тысячелетия, я слышала от людей, что они хотят добиться лучшего будущего.
И это крайне важно, поскольку некоторые люди говорят, что мы слишком наивные в наших надеждах сделать мир лучше. Действительно, мы добиваемся каких‑то успехов, может быть, не во всём, но всё‑таки мы двигаемся к успеху. Если мы сравним ЦРТ и ЦУР, ЦРТ в основном создавались для правительств, в основном для правительств богатых стран, которые преуспевают, для того чтобы продемонстрировать глобальную солидарность со странами Юга.
Но сейчас цели устойчивого развития показывают, что мир – это нечто большее, чем просто государство-нация, это также и бизнес-сообщество, это также проблема. Без системы, в которой будет больше игроков, нам будет сложно. И, как господин Фишер, бывший президент Австрийской Республики, говорил о системном анализе, думаю, что в рамках Валдайского клуба вы также могли бы подумать о том, как консультироваться с экспертами, которые специализируются на системном анализе. Я думаю, что это часть ответа на Ваш вопрос.
Также необходимы меры укрепления доверия. Это очень простые слова, и всё это лежит в основе государства-нации. Всё, что мы можем сделать в целях укрепления доверия, мы видим в Балтийском море, нашем общем море, а также на других, более крупных участках.
Мне было бы очень интересно узнать, поскольку мы сейчас в России, как Вы, господин Путин, видите это развитие, таким образом, в будущем. Думаю, что у меня есть некий луч надежды в отношении Вашего интереса, в отношении ООН.
Т.Колтон: Вы хотели бы сейчас ответить, господин Президент, или мы сначала выслушаем других ораторов?
В.Путин: Думаю, что выслушаем Хайнца и Табо.
Т.Колтон: Хорошо, спасибо.
Господин Фишер, пожалуйста.
Х.Фишер: Нам всем известно, что институты, а также неправильно созданные институты могут частично являться проблемой. Но в большинстве случаев они не представляют собой целую проблему, и те же самые институты, которые хорошо функционируют при определённых ситуациях, могут при других обстоятельствах, в другой среде, при другой экономической ситуации быть гораздо слабее и казаться неправильно созданными.
В том, что касается Европейского союза, в последние годы ситуация, если мы посмотрим, например, на торговые соглашения с Канадой, становится очевидно, что часть ответа на вопрос лежит в том, что необходимо создавать больше возможностей для центральных институтов в Европейском союзе, больше властных полномочий парламенту, больше власти комиссии, а также общая экономическая налоговая политика.
С другой стороны, очевидно, что именно это является очень чувствительной проблемой, и многие люди чувствуют, что наша автономия, наши возможности как государства всё больше передаются в Брюссель. И поэтому, если кто‑то говорит: давайте запустим процесс модернизации и изменения институтов Европейского союза, – на данный момент я бы сказал: давайте подождём, давайте не будем торопиться, поскольку на данный момент это создало бы очень проблемную ситуацию во многих европейских странах.
Что же касается Организации Объединённых Наций, то я с большим интересом прислушиваюсь к аргументам, согласно которым Совет Безопасности, являющийся наиболее влиятельным органом Организации Объединённых Наций, был создан более 70 лет назад. Так что в соответствии с этой аргументацией было бы полезно, было бы необходимо дать Совету Безопасности новую структуру, такую структуру, которая позволила бы ему эффективно работать в текущей обстановке, быть более представительным органом в том, что касается различных сторон государства.
Однако мы, конечно, понимаем сложности, сопряжённые с этим процессом. Если мы обратимся к нашим австрийским представителям в ООН с вопросом, возможно ли это, они скажут: нет, это совершенно невозможно, слишком расходятся мнения. Так что решение проблем при помощи реформирования институтов может быть только частью решения проблемы, частью того, что необходимо сделать.
Т.Колтон: Спасибо большое.
Т.Мбеки: Что должно быть сделано – это должно быть сделано. Вы знаете, когда госпожа Халонен говорила, что ООН концентрировалась на трёх столпах направления: на безопасности, на правах человека, и, в‑третьих, на развитии. Я в действительности убеждён, что, когда мы говорим о безопасности в глобальном масштабе, о правах человека в глобальном масштабе, о развитии в глобальном масштабе, невозможно решить какие бы то ни было из этих проблем в одиночку успешно на глобальном уровне, если мы не обратим свой взор вновь на Организацию Объединённых Наций в контексте Устава Организации Объединённых Наций, в контексте согласованной политики. Мне кажется, что участники конференции принимают это. Мир стал многополярным, и необходимо, чтобы эта многополярность перетекала в реальные действия на практике, для того чтобы успешно справляться с вызовами.
Каковы многополярные институты, которые сейчас существуют? Таким институтом должна быть ООН. Проблема реформирования Совета Безопасности становится именно в этом контексте особенно важной. Как сказал господин Фишер, Совет Безопасности создан очень давно, и он сейчас не отражает нынешнюю многополярную систему международных отношений. Он должен быть изменён, это сложно. Россия – член Совета Безопасности, может быть, она тоже является препятствием на пути этой реформы. Однако реформирование Совбеза должно произойти.
Мы должны также посмотреть на взаимоотношения Совета Безопасности и Генассамблеи, посмотреть на взаимоотношения с ЭКОСОС, то есть на все структуры. Они должны выражать многополярный характер мира, для того чтобы мы добились успеха на глобальном уровне в решении проблем, связанных с безопасностью, прав человека и развития. Это невозможно отбросить в сторону. Я не говорю, что это единственное, что необходимо сделать, но структуры должны быть укреплены, они должны быть более представительны и они должны быть также активизированы таким образом, чтобы все эти институты с уважением относились, во‑первых, к реформированному международному праву.
А во‑вторых, как сказал Президент Путин, необходимо… Я не говорю, что поскольку у нас есть ООН, то пропадает суверенитет. Суверенитет никуда не пропадает. Существует равенство государств. Само существование государств покоится на этом принципе, и это должно быть учтено при реформировании института ООН. Многополярный мир должен найти своё полноценное отражение в ООН. Если бы это произошло, то не было бы никакой катастрофы в Ливии, например.
Я завершаю уже свои комментарии. Когда мы говорим о целях устойчивого развития, они очень важны для Африканского континента и, я убеждён, для всех развивающихся стран. Одна из проблем, с которыми мы сталкиваемся на континенте, – это сложность переговоров с ЕС по соглашениям об экономическом партнёрстве. Более того, я считаю, что те переговоры, которые сейчас ведутся с ЕС, ведутся так, что многие требования ЕС противоречат требованиям ЦУР – целям устойчивого развития. Если вы посмотрите на глобальный уровень, то необходимо будет провести соотношение этих соглашений, с одной стороны, и целей устойчивого развития, посмотреть, не противоречат ли они друг другу. Вот о чём я хотел бы сказать. Спасибо большое.
Т.Колтон: Вы знаете, я был несколько взволнован. Я боялся, что мой вопрос не вызовет таких интересных ответов. Но спасибо большое.
Президент Путин, Вы не могли бы прореагировать на то, что было сказано?
В.Путин: Ещё маленькая ремарка по поводу того, что господин Фишер сказал. Он упомянул дискуссию в ЕС по поводу торгового договора с Канадой. Это чисто внутриеэсовское дело. Просто маленькая ремарка, если позволите.
Да, действительно, я знаю, что определённое раздражение в Европе вызывает позиция Валлонии, где всего три с половиной миллиона человек, и они, эти три с половиной, заблокировали принятие решения по такому глобальному вопросу, как торговое соглашение с Канадой. Но ведь, когда Бельгия создавала Евросоюз, она создавала его на определённых принципах и исходила из того, что и у неё в целом, и у Валлонии будут определённые права.
Если к сегодняшнему дню ЕС разросся очень сильно, изменился его состав и так далее, но права‑то никто не менял. Может быть, и нужно эти права поменять, но сначала нужно тогда предоставить людям, которые создавали эту организацию, демократическим образом права поменять, а потом уже требовать от них согласия.
Теперь что касается спора. Я знаю этот спор не так хорошо, как, конечно, европейцы, тем не менее, много или мало прерогатив у наднациональных органов в ЕС, замечу, я уже говорил об этом публично: количество обязательных решений, которые принимает Европарламент в отношении стран – членов ЕС, больше гораздо, чем количество обязательных решений, которые принимал Верховный Совет СССР в отношении республик Советского Союза во время существования самого СССР. Хорошо это или плохо – это не нам решать. Мы за то, чтобы Европа была сильной, централизованной – наша позиция. Но в самой Европе, там разные точки зрения, и это, надеюсь, когда‑нибудь завершится каким‑то позитивным решением.
Теперь по поводу ООН. Я уже говорил об этом, вынужден повторить: нам нужно обязательно вернуться к тому, что написано в Уставе ООН, потому что другой организации, такой универсальной, как ООН, в мире не существует. И если мы сейчас от неё откажемся – это верная дорога к хаосу. Ничего другого в мире универсального не существует. Да, ситуация поменялась в мире. Да, ООН и Совет Безопасности нуждаются в реформах и реконструкции. Но, как у нас в МИДе принято говорить, это можно сделать, если мы хотим, чтобы сохранялась эффективность этого инструмента, это можно сделать на основе широкого консенсуса. Нужно, чтобы с этими реформами согласилось подавляющее большинство участников международного общения.
Теперь почему нужно обязательно вернуться к единообразному пониманию принципов норм международного права, выработанных на основе Устава ООН? Потому что создавалась эта Организация после окончания Второй мировой войны, был определённый расклад сил в мире. Потом, после распада Советского Союза, Соединённые Штаты решили, что теперь, в общем‑то, не с кем согласовывать и не надо ни с кем согласовывать кардинальные вопросы. И началось.
Сначала в середине 90‑х годов – удары по Белграду. По сути, агрессия. Я сейчас не буду говорить про гуманитарную составляющую, которая предшествовала этим решениям, но просто наблюдать за ракетно-бомбовыми ударами в конце XX века в центре Европы… Не знаю, как вам, но для меня это было дикостью какой‑то, просто дико. Тем не менее это было в обход Устава ООН, никто же этого не санкционировал. Как только столкнулись с этим, сразу начали говорить, что устарело, надо бы чего‑нибудь поменять.
Дальше больше, дальше события в Ираке. ООН разве санкционировала действия в Ираке? Нет. А до этого был Афганистан в 2001 году. Да, мы знаем трагические события 11 сентября 2001 года, но всё равно по действующему международному праву надо было сходить в Совет Безопасности ООН и получить сначала там соответствующую резолюцию. Нет.
Потом Ирак. Потом принята была резолюция по Ливии – о чём резолюция по Ливии? Здесь же все эксперты, все знают, читали же все эту резолюцию. Что там написано? Бесполётная зона. Какая же бесполётная зона, если начали наносить ракетно-бомбовые удары по территории! Грубо извратили просто, опять нарушили Устав Организации Объединённых Наций.
Потом Сирия. Тарья, по‑моему, говорила или Хайнц выступал, что в Сирии только умножается число террористов из‑за действий в Алеппо. Разве с этого началось приумножение терроризма? Разве в Ираке были террористы? Близко не было никаких террористов до разрушения государственных структур страны. А в Ливии? Да ничего подобного там не было, никаких террористов, там и духу их не было. Как только разрушили государственность в стране, сразу этот вакуум был заполнен кем? Террористами. То же самое и в Сирии происходит.
Я понимаю намёк на наши действия в том же Алеппо или где. Но позвольте, как только началась война в Сирии, она началась задолго до нашего участия в этих событиях, там сразу и террористы появились, их начали снабжать оружием. Я же говорил об этом в своём выступлении. Их начали воспитывать, науськивать на Асада и так далее. Потому что других возможностей не было, они самые эффективные. И до сих пор это продолжается. Потому что это самые эффективные боевые подразделения. Их можно, как считают некоторые, направить, а потом мы, мол, с ними разберёмся. Ничего потом не будет! Не получится! В этом вся проблема.
И хотел бы тоже отреагировать на абсолютно правильные вещи, которые происходят, скажем, в Финляндии. Колокола звонят по погибшим в Алеппо. Давайте позвоним по погибшим сейчас в районе Мосула. Сейчас начинается операция в Мосуле. Уже, по‑моему, свыше 200 человек террористы расстреляли в надежде остановить наступление на город – давайте не будем про это забывать. А в Афганистане? Одним только ударом авиации уничтожали целые свадьбы по 120 человек, одним ударом! Мы забыли об этом? А сейчас что происходит в Йемене? Колокола должны звонить по всем этим безвинным жертвам! Согласен с Вами.
Мы всё время слышим: Алеппо, Алеппо, Алеппо… Ну да. Вопрос в чём? Или оставить там террористическое гнездо, или, минимизируя, делая всё, чтобы избежать жертв среди мирного населения, всё‑таки это гнездо дожать? Если не нужно вообще ничего трогать, тогда не нужно наступать и на Мосул. Давайте всё оставим как есть. Давайте Ракку не будем трогать. Ведь мы всё время слышим от наших партнёров: нужно наступать на Ракку, нужно уничтожить это гнездо терроризма. Но в Ракке тоже живут мирные граждане. Мы не будем с ними бороться вообще? Когда они где‑то в городах захватывают заложников, мы что, оставляем их в покое? Возьмите пример с Израиля, Израиль никогда так не делает, он всегда борется до конца и благодаря этому существует, да и другого выбора нет, надо бороться. Если мы постоянно будем сдавать позиции, мы всегда будем проигрывать.
Теперь о том, что Тарья спросила по поводу безопасности в районе Балтийского моря. Напомню, что эта тема возникла не по нашей инициативе, она возникла в ходе моего визита в Финляндию, в Наантали, и она возникла по инициативе Президента Финляндии господина Ниинистё. Он совершенно неожиданно для меня поставил вопрос о том, чтобы российская авиация не летала без включённых транспондеров. Для тех, кто далёк от военного дела, скажу, что это приборы, которые на самолётах стоят и подают сигнал о том, что они в воздухе находятся. И включение этих систем, конечно, увеличивает безопасность в районе Балтийского моря. Это правильно, это правда. Я сразу же сказал, что, во‑первых, количество полётов нашей авиации в разы уступает количеству полётов авиации стран НАТО, в разы. Это первое.
И второе. Я пообещал господину Президенту Финляндии, что мы обязательно поставим этот вопрос перед нашими партнёрами на ближайшей встрече в рамках Совета Россия–НАТО. Докладываю вам: мы это сделали. Результат: наши партнёры по НАТО предложение отклонили, более того, они сказали, что отклоняют предложение Путина. Путин здесь ни при чём, они отклоняют предложение господина Ниинистё, Президента Финляндской Республики.
Для нас тоже, между прочим, не так уж и просто это было, не так это было просто – пойти на такой шаг, потому что там есть технические вещи, есть и вещи чисто военного характера. Но я соответствующие указания Министерству обороны дал – поискать такую возможность, не нанося ущерба нашей безопасности. И наше Министерство обороны такую возможность нашло. Но наши коллеги из НАТО не хотят. Так что, пожалуйста, все вопросы туда, в Брюссель, в штаб-квартиру.
Т.Колтон: Тарья, насколько я понимаю, Вы хотели бы ответить коротко на этот вопрос?
Т.Халонен: Если позволите, я отвечу. Я очень рада, что у нас по‑прежнему продолжается замечательный диалог с Вами, господин Президент.
Это открытая дискуссия. Как правило, мы ведём такие дискуссии в меньших группах, тем не менее мне кажется, что предложение Президента Ниинистё было прекрасным примером. Считаю, что это важно для безопасности в нашем регионе. Однако, как сказал Президент Путин, есть очень много технических вопросов, других проблем с обеих сторон.
А это говорит нам о чём? Даже когда речь идёт о каком‑то ограниченном вопросе, требуется время, требуется сила. И тем не менее я считаю, что мы по‑прежнему все согласны. Нам необходимо добиться этого для того, чтобы обеспечить безопасность в регионе. Мы должны добиться принятия этих предложений. Надеюсь, что дискуссия будет продолжаться. И хорошая работа продолжится.
Позвольте мне так же коротко остановиться на других аспектах, которые были упомянуты Президентом Путиным. Конечно, Алеппо и Йемен – это те проблемы, о которых мы постоянно слышим в средствах массовой информации, в западных странах и в России тоже. Но здесь нет чёрного и белого. Это очень сложный вопрос. Но мы должны с уважением относиться к чувствам людей, они совершенно верно говорят: это неправильно. ЮНИСЕФ со стороны ООН тоже говорит о том, что то, что происходит, – неправильно. У нас есть, к счастью, эксперты, которые могут разобраться во всём этом.
Что же касается ООН, я очень рада, что мы много говорили об ООН, я сторонница ООН, я там работала, и я буду работать с ними, я обещала господину Пан Ги Муну, и следующему Генеральному секретарю я обещаю сотрудничество. Мы все понимаем, что если мы ничего делать не будем, то это может нам очень дорого обойтись.
Возьмём, например, Совет Безопасности. Я с большим интересом слушала то, что сказал Министр Лавров. Как мне кажется, если мы не сможем добиться успеха в Совете Безопасности, это ещё не всё, мы должны подумать о работе Генассамблеи, об ЭКОСОСе, ведь ООН – очень большая структура. Мы должны подталкивать их вперёд. И надеюсь, что мы добьёмся прогресса.
Спасибо за то, что Вы подняли эти вопросы, и эти вопросы и далее будут обсуждаться.
Т.Колтон: Сейчас я хотел бы поблагодарить всех и передать слово тем, кто присутствует в зале, для вопросов. У нас здесь представлено большое число экспертов, почти все хотят задать вопрос, и вы можете отвечать на вопросы, на которые хотите, отмечать их.
Хотел бы сказать, что, к сожалению, Ваша популярность, господин Президент, растёт; моя к концу дня, наверное, сократится. А времени у нас очень мало.
Позвольте, мы передадим слово сначала первым, кто заявил о желании задать вопросы. Многие из них, думаю, будут адресованы Президенту Путину. Однако если кто‑то желает тоже ответить, даже если они напрямую не направлены им, то, пожалуйста, отвечайте.
Вопрос (как переведено): Господин Президент, как Вам известно, растёт обеспокоенность международного сообщества относительно киберпространства, киберконфликтов. Ключевой вопрос состоит в следующем. Это обеспокоенность осуществления кибератак для достижения политических целей, учитывая, что вопрос кибератак очень молодой вопрос в отличие от других войн. Пространство кибератак очень известно, государства не должны использовать киберпространство для атаки на инфраструктуру других государств. Поэтому мой вопрос заключается в следующем.
Во‑первых, в теории. Я слышал, что Вы уже говорили, поэтому в теории: должны ли национальные избирательные системы считаться критической национальной инфраструктурой?
И второй вопрос: какие конкретные правила Вы бы предложили по мере того, как международное сообщество думает о киберпространстве, для того чтобы снизить угрозу кибервойн в будущем?
В.Путин: На мой взгляд, вмешательство во внутриполитические процессы, одной страны в другую, недопустимо вне зависимости от того, каким способом такие попытки могут предприниматься: с помощью кибератак либо с помощью каких‑то других инструментов, подконтрольных организаций внутри той или иной страны.
Например, вы знаете, что произошло в Турции, и знаете позицию Президента Турции Реджепа Эрдогана по поводу того, что он считает. А он считает, что попытка переворота в Турции была предпринята структурами, которые были воспитаны на идеях и при прямом участии организации некоего Гюлена, проживающего уже девять лет в Соединённых Штатах Америки. И это недопустимо, и кибератаки недопустимы.
Но нам не избежать, наверное, взаимного влияния друг на друга, в том числе и в киберпространстве. Но Вы задали вопрос конкретный, а именно Вы задали вопрос об избирательной системе. Я считаю, что это абсолютно недопустимо. А как избежать подобных эксцессов, если они где‑то будут возникать, нет никакого другого способа, как договариваться и вырабатывать определённые правила, причём такие правила, которые будут единообразно пониматься, будут признаны на правительственном, государственном уровне и могли бы быть проверяемыми.
Встаёт вопрос, конечно, о свободе интернета и всего, что с ним связано, но мы знаем, что очень во многих странах, в том числе и в тех, кто всегда выступал за свободу интернета, предпринимаются и на практике реализуются шаги по ограничению этого доступа, связанного с интересами большинства граждан. Это касается и преступлений, которые там могут готовиться либо совершаться в киберпространстве. Например, покушение на банковские системы, незаконные переводы денег, это касается всяких суицидов, преступлений против детей и так далее. Но эти же правила на национальном уровне принимаются, значит, мы можем принимать соответствующие правила и на национальном уровне в отношениях между государствами.
Т.Колтон: Спасибо.
Хотел бы предоставить слово господину Сушенцову, затем слово господину Быстрицкому.
Господин Сушенцов, Вам слово.
А.Сушенцов: Владимир Владимирович! Андрей Сушенцов, университет МГИМО, Валдайский клуб.
В зарубежных СМИ сложилось мнение, что у России есть однозначный фаворит на американских президентских выборах – Дональд Трамп. Какую на самом деле роль играет фигура следующего американского президента для России, для двусторонних отношений? И каким условиям должна удовлетворять американская внешняя политика по отношению к России, для того чтобы отношения нормализовались?
В.Путин: По поводу так называемых фаворитов или не фаворитов в избирательной кампании в Соединённых Штатах. Вы сказали о том, что это образ, который создан СМИ? Он и создан, этот образ, СМИ. Я Вас уверяю, не случайно. Я вообще редко вижу, когда что‑то случайно создаётся ведущими средствами массовой информации. Сама идея вброшена в общественное сознание в ходе президентской кампании в Соединённых Штатах, на мой взгляд, только с одной целью – с целью борьбы тех, кто защищает интересы кандидата от Демократической партии госпожи Клинтон в борьбе с представителем Республиканской партии, в данном случае в борьбе с господином Трампом.
Как это делается? Во‑первых, создаётся образ врага в виде Российской Федерации, в виде России, а потом объявляется, что Трамп – наш фаворит. Это полный бред и полная чушь! Это просто способ внутриполитической борьбы, способ манипулирования общественным мнением накануне президентских выборов в самих Соединённых Штатах.
Да, на самом деле я много раз говорил, хочу повторить: мы не знаем, как поведёт себя любой из кандидатов, который добьётся победы. Мы не знаем, как поведёт себя господин Трамп, мы не знаем, как поведёт себя госпожа Клинтон, если она будет избрана, что там будет исполнено, что не исполнено. Поэтому по большому счёту для нас это более или менее безразлично. Но, конечно, мы не можем не приветствовать слова, мысли, намерения, о которых публично говорится, о нормализации отношений между Соединёнными Штатами и Россией. И в этом смысле, конечно, мы приветствуем такие заявления, от кого бы они ни исходили. Вот, собственно говоря, и всё.
Что касается самого господина Трампа, он выбрал, видимо, свой способ достучаться до сердец избирателей. Какой? Он, конечно, ведёт себя экстравагантно, мы все это видим. Но, я думаю, не так уж это всё и бессмысленно. Потому что, на мой взгляд, он представляет интересы той части общества, а она значительная в Штатах, которая устала от тех самых элит, которые десятилетиями находятся у власти. Он просто представляет интересы таких простых людей.
Он и сам изображает из себя такого простого парня, который критикует тех, кто уже десятилетиями находится у власти, тех, кому не нравится (мы же читаем аналитику, в том числе и американскую) передача власти по наследству, допустим. Об этом прямо некоторые эксперты пишут в США. И он работает на этой «поляне».
Но насколько это будет для него эффективно, выборы покажут в ближайшее время. Но хочу повторить ещё раз один штамп, который всё время повторяю: мы будем работать с любым президентом, которого изберёт американский народ и который захочет работать с нами.
А.Быстрицкий: Владимир Владимирович, можно вопрос в развитие темы безопасности, которая только что поднималась? Понятно, что здесь ключевым и важным элементом, в этой теме безопасности, является взаимодействие. И понятно, что оно может быть сложным. Например, в случае упомянутых только что в разговоре транспондеров. Но в конце концов самолёты могут летать.
Но есть критически важные области, где речь идёт непосредственно о жизни людей, и жизни людей невинных. Вы недавно вспоминали дело Царнаевых. И, как я понимаю, информация с российской стороны была предоставлена, но это не возымело ни малейшего действия, как я тоже понимаю. Означает ли это, что на таком практическом уровне взаимодействия в сфере безопасности ситуация критическая?
В.Путин: Я уже говорил об этом. Не помню когда. По‑моему, на встрече с французскими журналистами, что ли? Да, действительно, мы предоставили в своё время информацию по этим братьям Царнаевым американским партнёрам. Написали один раз – ответа никакого. Потом ещё раз написали – опять никакого ответа нет. И уже после второго письма пришел ответ, что они наши граждане, вы сюда не лезьте, мы сами разберёмся. Ладно, я директору ФСБ сказал: всё, сдаю в архив. Так ответ у нас в архиве и лежит до сих пор.
Но потом, к сожалению, через несколько месяцев произошёл теракт в Бостоне во время известного марафона, погибли люди. Очень жаль, что эта трагедия произошла. Если бы контакты и доверие были бы на другом уровне между нами и нашими партнёрами, уверен, можно было бы избежать этой трагедии. Потом у нас и американцы появились сразу, приехали, мы отдали материалы, которые у нас были. Но поздно, уже люди‑то погибли.
Это, кстати говоря, отчасти ответ на предыдущий вопрос. Те, кто хочет с нами работать, – я не знаю, будут они или не будут, но они формулируют правильно тезис о том, что это необходимо для всех, особенно на поле борьбы с терроризмом. В этом смысле мы приветствуем, повторяю, всех, кто об этом заявляет.
Но, скажем, я тоже уже говорил об этом, например, в ходе подготовки к Олимпийским играм здесь, в Сочи, американцы реально нам помогали. И я благодарен им за это, мы все им за это благодарны, они сотрудничали и здесь, на месте, сотрудничали с нами очень эффективно и на более высоком уровне – на уровне руководства спецслужб. Были и другие примеры хорошего сотрудничества.
В целом у нас неплохо обстоят дела по этому направлению с европейскими партнёрами, как раз с французскими спецслужбами, там достаточно откровенный, профессиональный разговор идёт, обмен информацией имеет место быть. В общем, не всё так плохо, но могло бы быть гораздо лучше.
Т.Колтон: Хорошо.
Хотел бы сейчас предоставить слово Сафине Фишер из Берлина.
С.Фишер: Спасибо. Мой вопрос Президенту Путину, он касается Украины.
Президент Путин, недавно после достаточно длинной паузы состоялась встреча «нормандской четвёрки» в Берлине. И после этой встречи стороны несколько по‑разному интерпретировали результаты переговоров. Поэтому мне бы очень хотелось услышать Вашу оценку результатов и атмосферы этой встречи.
Помимо этого, считаете ли Вы «нормандский формат» в данной форме эффективным или Вы думаете, что он мог бы работать более продуктивно, если бы, например, туда присоединились Соединённые Штаты Америки?
Спасибо большое.
В.Путин: Можно уточняющий вопрос? Какая разная интерпретация была результатов встречи? О чём Вы говорите? Как ни странно, я просто не слышал этих разных интерпретаций. Какие?
С.Фишер: Были обсуждения полицейской миссии в Донбассе, с одной стороны, и упор на «дорожную карту», которая делалась, например, в России в СМИ и тоже в политических дебатах. По‑моему, это действительно были разные интерпретации результатов.
В.Путин: Здесь секрета никакого нет. Я скажу, вообще как было. Некоторые вещи, может быть, не буду говорить, чтобы не ставить никого в трудное положение и не мешать самому процессу.
Как вы знаете, в Минских соглашениях, думаю, что эксперты все читали, там чёрным по белому написано: через 30 дней после подписания Минских соглашений на Украине Рада должна принять постановление, которое очертило бы географические границы районов, в которых начал бы сразу действовать закон об особом статусе этих непризнанных республик. Потому что единственное, чего не хватало, чтобы он начал работать, было отсутствие описания этих географических границ.
И это нужно было принять не законом, а постановлением парламента, и это постановление с нарушением сроков, но тем не менее было принято. И, казалось бы, этот закон должен был бы сразу вступить в действие. Он был принят, хочу напомнить, парламентом Украины, проголосован, и он был согласован с непризнанными республиками, что очень важно, и в этом смысле он является, на мой взгляд, жизнеспособным и ключевым элементом политического урегулирования.
Но, приняв это постановление Рады, украинская сторона, парламент страны принял дополнение к этому закону пунктом в статью девятую или десятую, в которой написал, что этот закон вступит только тогда, когда произойдут муниципальные выборы на этих территориях. То есть опять отложил вступление этого закона в силу, повторяю, по нашему мнению, абсолютно ключевого для политического урегулирования кризиса на юго-востоке страны. Причём сделал это, конечно, уже ни с кем не согласовывая, с этими непризнанными республиками даже не консультировались.
Год назад в Париже мы это очень активно обсуждали, спорили. Я настаивал на том, чтобы это было сделано, и сделано незамедлительно, поскольку это прописано в Минских соглашениях и является ключевым элементом, на наш взгляд. Тем не менее Президент Украины настаивал на том, что это сделать невозможно. И зашло всё в тупик. Поскольку зашло в тупик, и всё могло закончиться сразу же на месте год назад в Париже, неожиданно Министр иностранных дел ФРГ господин Штайнмайер предложил компромисс.
Он сказал: «Давайте мы так договоримся. Этот закон вступит в силу в день выборов в муниципальные органы власти на этих территориях на временной основе, и на постоянной – после того как БДИПЧ ОБСЕ признает, что выборы состоялись в соответствии с правилами ОБСЕ». Это было совсем не то, что написано в Минских соглашениях, но, чтобы не заводить дело в тупик, я согласился и сказал: «Хорошо, договорились. Мы это согласуем с Донецком и Луганском». И мы согласовали.
Но на встрече в Берлине вдруг неожиданно Президент Украины попытался изменить и эту формулу, уже как бы компромиссную. Пошёл ещё дальше, по сути, отказываясь вообще от имплементации этого закона когда бы то ни было. Опять возник тот же самый кризис, который мы имели в Париже год назад. Но я хочу отметить роль Федерального канцлера. Она всё‑таки нашла аргументы и убедила всех собравшихся в том, что мы можем и должны остаться на согласованной позиции, и невозможно каждый раз, встречаясь через год, менять то, о чём мы договаривались до этого, так мы никогда ни о чём не сможем договориться. Но нюансы и детали того, как это должно имплементироваться, договорились погрузить в ту концепцию, о которой Вы сказали и которую предстоит ещё выработать.
Вот, пожалуй, и всё. Но в принципе много было сделано по вопросам обеспечения безопасности – там мы практически согласовали почти каждый из пунктов. Почти ни о чём не договорились по вопросам гуманитарного характера – эти территории остаются в строгой блокаде, и ситуация там очень сложная. На это, кстати говоря, весь так называемый цивилизованный мир предпочитает не обращать никакого внимания. Сейчас не хочу даже открывать дискуссии на эту тему.
Но что касается формата, он полезен или не полезен, – просто другого нет. Да, дискуссии идут сложно, да, это не очень эффективно, соглашусь с этим, но другого нет, и если мы хотим хоть чего‑то добиться, надо оставаться в рамках этого формата.
Нужно ли привлекать кого‑то другого? Российская позиция такая: мы не против привлекать кого бы то ни было, в том числе и наших американских партнёров. Но договорились таким образом со всеми участниками этого процесса, что мы с нашими американскими коллегами будем работать параллельно. И вы знаете, мой помощник и госпожа Нуланд постоянно встречаются, регулярно эти темы обсуждают, ищут компромиссы. Но это, разумеется, делается не келейно, не тайно, и все участники нормандского формата в курсе, знают, и мы учитываем, конечно, и позицию наших американских партнёров.
Т.Колтон: Анджела Стент, пожалуйста.
А.Стент (как переведено): Спасибо. Мой вопрос адресован Президенту Путину. Я профессор Джорджтаунского университета Вашингтона.
Россия недавно вышла из соглашения с Соединёнными Штатами по уничтожению плутония, но в то же время российское Правительство заявило, что рассмотрит повторное вступление к соглашению, если будут выполнены три условия. Первое, что войска НАТО должны вернуться к тем позициям, которые они занимали до 2000‑х годов в Европе, во‑вторых, «закон Магнитского» должен быть отменён, и в‑третьих, что санкции, введённые против России с момента начала украинского кризиса, должны быть сняты, и России должна быть предоставлена компенсация.
Вопрос заключается в следующем. 20 января у нас будет новый президент, я настроена оптимистично, должны ли мы понимать в США, что эти три условия лягут в основу изначальной переговорной позиции со стороны Российской Федерации с новым американским президентом, когда он вновь восстановит отношения высокого уровня с Кремлём?
В.Путин: Вы профессор, сразу видно, что не дипломат. Если Вы у дипломатов спросите, они Вам скажут, что есть такое понятие, как запросная позиция, и решение по поводу договора об уничтожении избыточного количества оружейного плутония – мы из него не вышли. Соединённые Штаты вышли из договора по противоракетной обороне, а мы не вышли, мы приостановили его действие. Но почему? Я думаю, что все здесь знают почему. Это соглашение что предусматривало? Оно предусматривало, что и в России, и в США будут построены заводы, которые будут уничтожать избыточное количество оружейного плутония, наработанного как в США, так и в России.
США свои обязательства не только не выполнили, а объявили, что выполнять не намерены – со ссылкой на финансовые трудности. Как будто у нас таких финансовых трудностей нет. Но мы завод построили и уничтожаем этот плутоний промышленным способом. То, что объявили Соединённые Штаты, причём в одностороннем порядке, никак с нами свои действия не согласовывая… Они сказали, что они будут его разбавлять, этот оружейный плутоний, там хранить в каких‑то пластах и так далее.
Это значит, специалисты говорят, это называется возвратный потенциал. В любую секунду можно вернуть, опять обогатить, и всё снова здорово, как у нас в народе говорят. А мы‑то уничтожаем его промышленным способом. Мы завод построили, деньги истратили. Мы что, богаче Соединённых Штатов, что ли?
И очень по многим вопросам нам очень трудно разговаривать с администрацией сегодняшней, потому что ничего почти не выполняется, почти никакие договорённости не исполняются, в том числе и по Сирии. Может, ещё к этому вернёмся. Но мы готовы будем разговаривать с новым президентом и искать решения любых сложных вопросов, любых.
Вопрос (как переведено): Господин Президент, хотел бы задать Вам вопрос по политике России в отношении Азии. Сегодня акцент делается на построении многополярного мира во внешней политике России. Но помимо этого вы также уделяете особое внимание многополярности в Азии. Сегодня в Вашей речи Вы, в частности, на мой взгляд, указали на рост напряжённости в отношениях с Западом и о переориентировании на Азию. Но есть и проблемы в Азии. В частности, появление новых игроков ведёт к появлению страхов, появляются новые разделительные барьеры. Скажите, есть ли опасность того, что Россия путём акцента на многополярном мире может недооценить опасность однополярной Азии в ущерб необходимости всех великих держав работать вместе для создания нового мира?
В.Путин: Мы интенсифицируем развитие наших отношений с азиатскими странами не потому, что у нас напряглись отношения с Европой или Соединёнными Штатами. Просто то, что сейчас происходит, диктуется самой жизнью. Необходимость расширения наших контактов, увеличение этих контактов диктуются жизнью. Почему?
Рост и значение азиатских стран растут и будут расти дальше, причём достаточно высокими темпами. Но для России, значительная часть территории которой находится в Азии, было бы нелепым не использовать своё географическое преимущество и не развивать отношения с нашими соседями.
Китай – наш сосед, я говорил об этом во вступительном слове. С Индией у нас хорошая предыстория отношений, что грех было бы это не использовать для развития отношений с Индией сегодня и на длительную историческую перспективу. У нас много совпадающих интересов. Мы естественным образом взаимодополняем друг друга, кстати говоря, как в политике, так и в экономике.
Но что касается многополярности или однополярности Азии, Азия не является однополярной, мы это прекрасно видим и понимаем.
Жизнь вообще сложна и многообразна, она вообще вся соткана из противоречий. Важно только, чтобы эти противоречия разрешались цивилизованным способом. Мне кажется, что у лидеров азиатских стран сегодня достаточно здравого смысла, чтобы выйти именно на такой режим работы друг с другом. И мы готовы работать в таком же режиме со всеми.
Вы знаете, что я недавно был с визитом в Индии, только что вернулся из Индии наш Министр обороны. У нас не только по линии оборонных ведомств, по линии промышленного производства в оборонной сфере, но и в гражданских областях очень много пересекающихся интересов с Индией, Китаем, тем же Вьетнамом, с другими странами региона. И они очень перспективные и масштабные.
Т.Колтон: Тома Гомар, пожалуйста.
Т.Гомар (как переведено): Господин Президент, в сентябре 2014 года на Валдайском клубе Вы описали отношения между Украиной и Россией следующим предложением: две страны – один народ. А каким образом Вы сегодня описали бы отношения между этими двумя странами?
В.Путин: Я сейчас не буду говорить про то, кто в чём виноват, но я считаю, как и считал, что русские и украинцы – это действительно один народ. У нас есть люди крайних националистических взглядов, как в России, так и в Украине. Но в целом в большинстве своём это один народ – народ одной истории, одной культуры, очень близкий этнически. Нас сначала разделили, а потом стравили, но мы сами в этом виноваты. И мы должны сами найти выход из этой ситуации. Уверен, что здравый смысл восторжествует, и мы этот выход найдём.
Вопрос: Уважаемый господин Президент! До моего вопроса хотел бы очень коротко передать Вам слова моих молодых студентов. Два года назад, когда Вы были в Шанхае по очень важным другим делам, наши студенты пропустили шанс встретиться в университете с Вами и Вас спросить. Но они сказали мне, что всегда Вас ждут. И это не зависит от того, будете Вы на пенсии или нет.
Мой вопрос такой. Сегодня мы обсуждаем философский вопрос международных отношений. Человеческое сообщество уже переживало многие вариантов международной системы. По Вашему представлению, будущие системы до какой степени будут похожи на бывшие? И на какие положительные элементы нам больше нужно обращать внимания? Это немножко теоретически, по каким принципам, более универсальным или более многообразным? Какие сочетания, какие комбинации среди них Вы предпочитаете?
Ещё конкретный вопрос. В текущие дни очень оживлённо обсуждаем вопрос, какие взаимоотношения между Россией, Западом и Китаем.
В.Путин: Хайнц здесь такую ремарку сделал, что это очень философский вопрос, об этом можно долго рассуждать.
Будет ли мир будущего таким, каким он был в прошлом? Конечно, нет. Разве это возможно? Мир меняется очень сильно. Разве Китай 60–70‑х годов похож на Китай сегодняшнего дня? Совсем две разные страны, да и Советского Союза нет.
Господин Мбеке говорил про Африку. Я с этими тезисами согласен. Но Африка не может быть где‑то на периферии. Если кто‑то так думает, то он глубоко заблуждается. Если мы будем действовать именно таким образом, нас ждут очень тяжёлые испытания. Мы уже сейчас видим, говорят: беженцы-беженцы, Сирия-Сирия. Я сегодня только смотрел – очередное событие в Средиземном море, где итальянская береговая охрана вылавливала беженцев из Африки. При чём здесь Сирия? Вы знаете, это очень серьёзный вопрос – будущее мира и будущее Африки. Так же и взаимоотношения в Азии, там много конфликтных, таких потенциально конфликтных ситуаций.
Хочу повторить то, что я только что сказал. Вопрос в том, хватит ли у нас ума и мужества найти приемлемые способы решения всех этих проблем и сложных конфликтов. Мне бы очень хотелось, чтобы это было именно так, чтобы мир действительно стал многополярным и чтобы учитывались мнения всех участников международного сообщества. Маленькая это страна или большая, должны быть единообразно понимаемые общие правила, гарантирующие суверенитет и интересы народов.
А что касается наших взаимоотношений между нашими партнёрами в Европе, в Соединённых Штатах, в Америке вообще, в азиатских странах, мы выстраиваем разновекторную политику, и не только в силу своего географического положения. Наша политика в отношении всех наших партнёров строится на основе равноправия и взаимного уважения.
Т.Колтон: Хорошо.
Николай Злобин, пожалуйста.
Н.Злобин: Владимир Владимирович, у меня вопрос тоже философский, но я подразумеваю, что Вы уже думали на эту тему, поэтому хотел бы получить от Вас ответ в Вашем стиле. Вы умеете формулировать афористично, мы все это знаем.
Я вернусь к Вашей речи, к ней пока никто не апеллировал. Я не согласен с одной вещью в Вашей речи, где Вы описывали мир. Вы описывали его правильно, но мне кажется, что сводить всё к злой воле элит или каких‑то отдельных лидеров, это не совсем правильно. Страны действуют под влиянием очень большого количества объективных факторов. Даже Вы сейчас, говоря о евразийском сотрудничестве, сказали, что жизнь требует так поступать. Я помню, когда была история с Крымом, Вы сказали: я не мог поступить иначе, хотя весь мир считал, что это не самый лучший жест доброй воли.
Мой вопрос в этой связи. Думаю, что страны действуют под влиянием национальных интересов, того, как они видят мир. И очень часто эти национальные интересы входят в противоречия, одной страны и другой страны.
Однажды в интервью какому‑то западному агентству Вы сказали, что Ваша работа – продвигать национальные интересы России. Поэтому я подозреваю, что Вы знаете, что такое национальные интересы России, причём не тактические, не сегодняшние, а фундаментальные, которые существовали раньше и будут существовать потом. Думаю, что Вам ещё рано на пенсию уходить, но всё равно когда‑нибудь это случится, и национальные интересы сохранятся. Есть у Вас формула в голове, ёмкая, хорошая, как объяснить миру? Потому что одна из проблем, что Россия воспринимается страной непредсказуемой. Можете Вы объяснить одной формулой, которая сохранится надолго, что такое национальные интересы России?
В.Путин: То, что хорошо для русского человека, то и национальные интересы России и вообще для народов Российской Федерации. Но вопрос не в том, чтобы любой ценой продвигать эти национальные интересы, вопрос в том, как это делать. Я хочу вернуть нас к ставшему ключевым вопросу: мы считаем, что добиваться своих национальных интересов нужно в диалоге со всеми участниками международной жизни, уважая их интересы и пользуясь единообразно понимаемыми правилами игры, которые называются «международное право».
Кстати, когда выступала Тарья, она сказала, что несколько мрачновато прозвучали мои оценки. Если именно так и восприняли, что исключительно в ошибках элит заключаются все проблемы сегодняшнего дня, то, конечно, я не это имел в виду. Это одна из серьёзных проблем сегодняшнего дня – расхождения между интересами так называемых широких масс и правящими классами, но не единственная, а в основе, конечно, лежат и интересы, но способы достижения своих интересов важны, вот что важно.
А.Мухин: Владимир Владимирович, на Украине постоянно пытаются что‑нибудь запретить российское. И складывается такое ощущение, что любые российские компоненты просто выдавливаются из украинского общества. В этой связи у меня тоже философский вопрос. Пётр Порошенко говорил о том, что он намерен продать свой российский бизнес. Этот бизнес существует вообще или нет? И как Вы к этому относитесь?
В.Путин: Мы стремимся к тому, чтобы уважать право собственности. Алексей Леонидович – горячий приверженец, считает, что это один из столпов экономической политики, и в этом смысле я с ним полностью согласен. У нас далеко не всегда так получается, нам практику нужно ещё поправлять, и в законодательстве многое нужно сделать, но мы всегда будем к этому стремиться.
То же самое касается и наших иностранных инвесторов, в том числе и украинских инвесторов. Пётр Алексеевич Порошенко является одним из таких инвесторов, имею в виду, что он является собственником достаточно крупного предприятия в Липецкой области – фабрики «Рошен». Там, собственно, два предприятия, второе занимается, по‑моему, реализацией продукции. Там есть некоторые проблемы, связанные с невозвратом НДС, и судебные органы ввели определённые ограничительные меры, но фабрика работает, работает ритмично, выплачивает зарплату, получает прибыль, и нет никаких ограничений, связанных с использованием этой прибыли, в том числе и с переводом её за границу. Я сейчас не помню, сколько, не погружаюсь в такие детали, но она работает с прибылью, и работает успешно.
П.Дуткевич: Господин Президент, я уже задал этот вопрос заместителю Министра иностранных дел вчера, но я понял свою ошибку, потому что исключительным адресатом этого вопроса являетесь Вы, Владимир Владимирович.
Вопрос такой: поступила информация, я не знаю, насколько она достоверна, что во время встречи с господином Обамой в Китае в сентябре этого года Вы разговаривали о перемирии в Сирии. Не знаю, насколько это достоверно, но Вам предложили семидневное перемирие. Вы засомневались и сказали, что невозможно за такой короткий период развести радикалов от мирных, и вряд ли можно это сделать. Поэтому Вам на это был ответ, что если мы не сумеем это сделать, тогда у вас свободные руки. Вы можете вспомнить этот разговор? Потому что он очень важный для истории того, что происходит сейчас в Сирии.
В.Путин: Да мне и не нужно его вспоминать, я его и не забывал. Это очень важный разговор. Там действительно шла речь о том, чтобы прекратить работу российской и сирийской авиации по нанесению ударов по объектам террористов в Алеппо до разделения так называемой здоровой части оппозиции от «Джабхат ан-Нусры» – террористической организации, признанной в таком качестве Организацией Объединённых Наций, входящей в перечень международных террористических организаций.
В этой связи хотел бы заметить, что не секретом является то, что нам наши американские партнёры обещали это сделать. Они признали, во‑первых, что это нужно сделать, они признали, что часть Алеппо занята террористическими организациями – и ИГИЛ, и «Джабхат ан-Нусрой». Собственно говоря, это видно на кадрах телевизионной хроники, когда мы видим знамя ИГИЛ, знамя «Джабхат ан-Нусры» в определённых районах Алеппо. Они признали, что это надо сделать, и заверили нас, что сделают это.
А после этого мы договорились о том, что вместе определим прямо на поле боя, где здоровая часть оппозиции, и мы их не будем трогать вообще, а где террористы, и мы будем вместе с американскими нашими партнёрами работать по этим террористам. Они обещали нам многократно и на уровне Минобороны, и на уровне министров иностранных дел, и на уровне специальных служб. К сожалению, раз за разом всё это срывалось, и они этого не делали.
В очередной раз этот вопрос был поднят во время нашей встречи в Китае. Действительно, мой американский партнёр, Президент Обама, предложил в очередной раз их развести. Но он настаивал на том, чтобы сначала мы объявили день Д, день тишины, прекратили бы боевые действия, удары авиации, а затем в течение семи дней они брали бы на себя обязательство развести оппозицию здоровую и «Джабхат ан-Нусру» друг с другом. Я сейчас не буду говорить о деталях, потому что не считаю себя вправе какие‑то детали воспроизводить вслух. Всё‑таки в ходе таких переговоров остаётся какая‑то часть, которая доверительно доводится друг до друга. Но факт остаётся фактом.
Вместо того чтобы развести террористов, «Джабхат ан-Нусру», и здоровую часть оппозиции, наши американские партнёры сами сорвали это перемирие. Кстати говоря, в конечном итоге я хоть и настаивал на том, что сначала развести нужно, а потом прекратить полёты авиации, но в ходе дискуссии согласился с мнением американского партнёра. Он настаивал, и я с ним согласился, пошёл навстречу, сказал: ладно, бог с ним, мы сначала объявляем перемирие, не будем летать, не будем наносить удары, пожалуйста, вот вам семь дней.
Перемирие было объявлено, по‑моему, 12 сентября. 17‑го американская авиация нанесла удар по сирийским войскам, после чего подразделения ИГИЛ перешли в наступление. Нам сказали, что удар был нанесён по ошибке, а ИГИЛ перешёл в наступление случайно, это случайность. Может быть, и так, но перемирие было сорвано и далеко не по нашей вине.
А что там обещал или что не обещал Президент Соединённых Штатов, это всё‑таки Вы спрашивайте у него. Я думаю, что в ходе, допустим, своей поездки по европейским странам он сам об этом расскажет нашим европейским уже партнёрам. И думаю, что нужно сделать это откровенно и честно, а не просто использовать их для того, чтобы повлиять на нашу позицию по Сирии.
Да, кстати говоря, вы знаете, сегодня уже девятый день, когда российская и сирийская авиация в районе Алеппо просто не работает. Вот вам ещё не семь дней, вот вам ещё девять, уже десять дней сейчас будет. Где разведение террористов и здоровой части оппозиции? Понимаете, если мы не будем выполнять взятых на себя обязательств, мы никогда не добьёмся успеха в решении задач борьбы с террором.
Я понимаю, это непростая задача, и мы здесь не склонны никого ни в чём обвинять, но уж если о чём‑то договорились, надо исполнять. Во всяком случае, на нас не перекладывать вину и не обвинять во всех смертных грехах. Это просто неприлично. Мы пока ведём себя сдержанно и также по‑хамски нашим партнёрам не отвечаем, но всё имеет свои границы, можем и ответить.
Т.Колтон: Господин Черногорский из Словакии. Пожалуйста, Вам слово.
Черногорский: Я буду как будто продолжать вопрос Анджелы Стент, хотя мы не договорились. Господин Президент, условия, которые, Вы сказали, в связи с договором об утилизации плутония, по сути, являются наступательными условиями. Когда бы эти условия были исполнены, это бы означало практически, что будут аннулированы все отступления России практически со времён Михаила Горбачёва. Меня интересует время. Как Вы оцениваете, когда бы такие условия могли быть исполнены или, скажу это по‑другому, думаете, что Вы увидите исполнение этих условий ещё как Президент Российской Федерации?
В.Путин: Условия, о которых Вы говорили сейчас и которые Вы назвали наступательными, они изложены на бумаге. Это Указ Президента Российской Федерации. Это бумажка.
А условия уничтожения оружейного плутония, которые нарушили Соединённые Штаты, – это очень серьёзный вопрос в сфере международной безопасности и обращения ядерных материалов. Это совершенно две разные категории. И мы вышли из этого договора, потому что Соединённые Штаты не выполняют взятых на себя обязательств. А об условиях того, как вести нам переговорный процесс по широкому кругу проблем, мы договоримся.
Т.Колтон: Михаил Погребинский, пожалуйста, из Киева.
М.Погребинский: Владимир Владимирович, возвращаюсь к вопросу, который был задан коллегой из Германии. Мне кажется, Вы не вполне ответили на него, а это важно, по‑моему.
Речь идёт о том, что, действительно, насколько мы понимаем, интерпретации результатов этого Берлина были разные в Киеве и в Москве. Во всяком случае, два слова скажу, что киевская интерпретация такая: главный успех Порошенко на этих переговорах – это то, что он убедил ООН и вообще участники переговоров убедили Вас в том, что Вы согласились на полицейскую миссию.
При этом в Киеве понимают эту полицейскую миссию как некую такую систему, которая будет с оружием обеспечивать безопасность до проведения выборов и после проведения выборов какое‑то время. Информация из Москвы официальная была такая, что, в общем, не совсем так.
Можете внести какую‑то ясность по этому поводу, чтобы было понятно?
В.Путин: Я могу попросить Тарью или Ханца, они очень хорошо знают, что такое ОБСЕ, как работает эта организация. Скажу Вам свою позицию по этому вопросу.
Президент Порошенко выступил с инициативой так называемой полицейской миссии во время проведения будущих возможных выборов в Донбассе, в Донецке и Луганске. Я единственный, кто его поддержал. Просто я не называю это полицейской миссией в силу того, что вообще все остальные участники процесса возражают, а возражают не потому, что не хотят помочь Петру Алексеевичу, а потому, что ОБСЕ никогда ничего подобного не делала, у неё нет такого опыта, нет людей, нет практики осуществления каких бы то ни было полицейских миссий.
И на сегодняшний день эта идея, выдвинутая Петром Алексеевичем Порошенко и поддержанная Вашим покорным слугой, она другими участниками этого процесса не поддерживается, но мы называем это не полицейской миссией, а возможностью тех, кто будет обеспечивать выборы и безопасность на выборах, находиться там с табельным стрелковым оружием. Те, кто против реализации этого предложения, указывают на то, что это может спровоцировать неизвестно кого на применение оружия против вооружённых людей.
Они считают, что сила наблюдателей ОБСЕ заключается не в том, что у них табельное оружие, а в том, что они как раз представляют общепризнанную мировую солидную международную организацию, и как раз они сами не вооружены, и применять против них силу и оружие – это абсолютно неприемлемо и будет восприниматься как самое неприемлемое поведение кого бы то ни было. И в этом их сила, а не в том, что у них будет пистолет.
Хотя, если Пётр Алексеевич считает, что это пошло бы на пользу, я лично его поддерживаю, но я единственный, кто это делает. Это странная ситуация, это единственное, где наши мнения совпадают. Но я уже об этом говорил неоднократно, и здесь нет никакой новизны, и в конечном итоге все согласились, что это возможно, но нужно это проработать, в том числе на площадке ОБСЕ. Не знаю, Тарья меня поправит, но, по‑моему, в практике ОБСЕ никогда такого не было. Тарья, можно тебя спросить?
Т.Халонен: Да, должна честно сказать, что не могу припомнить таких случаев. Возможно, стоит спросить кого‑то, у кого есть более актуальная информация, но я займусь этим вопросом.
Т.Колтон: Представитель, пожалуйста, из Пекина.
Вопрос (как переведено): Бывший Президент Австрийской Республики господин Фишер сказал, что отношения между ЕС и Россией не такие, как 25 лет назад ожидалось, какими они будут. И, к сожалению, это сейчас имеет место, но нам нужно быть оптимистами тем не менее.
И хочу спросить господина Президента: с Вашей точки, почему это так происходит? И какие могут быть ожидания? Какие ожидания 25 лет назад были неверными или были неверными всё время? И с философской точки зрения какие уроки, как Вам кажется, следует извлечь для следующих 25 лет?
В.Путин: Что было сделано правильно, а что неправильно? Ожидания были большие в связи с тем, что Советский Союз перешёл к политике открытости, в связи с тем что практически то, что считалось главным, что разделяло Советский Союз и потом Россию, и западный мир, исчезло – я имею в виду идеологические разногласия. И, откровенно говоря, у нас сначала и в Советском Союзе при Горбачёве, а дальше и в России все считали, что сейчас начнётся совершенно другая жизнь. Вот здесь один из наших экспертов правильно сказал: существуют вещи, как оказалось, гораздо более глубинные, чем даже идеологические противоречия, а это так называемые и национальные, и геополитические интересы.
Можно было бы сделать что‑то по‑другому? Да, можно. Я на прошлой встрече здесь, по‑моему, в этом зале, говорил: был такой немецкий политик господин Рау, известный деятель Социал-демократической партии Германии, его уже нет среди нас, но он тогда вёл очень активную дискуссию с руководством Советского Союза. И он тогда говорил – у нас есть записи этих бесед, мы до сих пор никак не можем это опубликовать, но надо это сделать, – что в Европе должна быть создана новая система международной безопасности.
Помимо НАТО нужно создать ещё структуру, в которую входил бы и Советский Союз, и те страны, которые выходят из Варшавского договора, но с участием США, с тем чтобы была сбалансированная система. И дальше он продолжал, что если этого не будет сделано, в конечном итоге это будет приводить к тому, что вся эта система, созданная во времена холодной войны, будет работать против Советского Союза. И он говорил, что это беспокоит меня только потому, что это будет разбалансировать всю систему международных отношений и вопросы безопасности в Европе будут подвергаться серьёзным испытаниям.
Как этот дед сказал, так и случилось. И тогда вот те люди, которые работали над преобразованиями в мире, одни не хотели ничего менять, им представлялось, что и так они на коне, а другие не имели политической воли, чтобы реализовать эти абсолютно правильные мысли очень мудрого и опытного немецкого политика.
Но я надеюсь, что всё‑таки с изменением реального соотношения сил в мире будет меняться и политико-дипломатическое и нормативное сопровождение этих изменений в лучшую сторону. Мир будет более сбалансированным и многополярным.
Х.Фишер: Могу добавить следующее, что 25 лет назад, в начале 90‑х годов, в Европейском союзе было 12 членов. Швеция, Финляндия, Австрия присоединились лишь в 1994–1995 годах. Это была эпоха такого «медового месяца» между Россией и Европой, в частности между Россией и Германией, Россией и другими важными странами Европы. Это был период до экономического кризиса, когда темпы экономического роста были более высокими, перед введением евро. Введение евро – очень важная мера, но евро – это также проблематичный компонент, если вы посмотрите на ситуацию в Греции или в Италии. Такие факторы тоже следует принимать во внимание.
Спасибо.
Т.Халонен: Я также хотела бы добавить, что 25 лет назад Россия была другой, Европейский союз был другим. Я также была вовлечена в этот процесс. Думаю, что урок, который мы могли бы извлечь со стороны ЕС и со стороны Совета ЕС – это была очень хорошая возможность для расширения. Возможно, нам следовало бы больше вкладывать в процесс расширения, не только до процесса расширения, но и после процесса расширения. И, возможно, процесс проходил бы легче сегодня. Но, конечно, всегда времени не хватает. Мы не можем вернуться в прошлое, мы сейчас стараемся строить будущее дальше.
Т.Колтон: Габор Штиер, пожалуйста.
Г.Штиер: Мой вопрос Президенту Путину об Украине.
С приближением зимы обычно в последние годы часто говорим о том, что будет на Украине, что будет с безопасностью экспорта российского газа. Будет ли тепло в украинских квартирах? Будет ли Киев платить за газ? Откуда будет покупать? Мой вопрос следующий. Ведутся ли переговоры о поставке газа теперь в Украину? И говорили ли об этом с украинским Президентом в Берлине?
В.Путин: У нас вызывает обеспокоенность то, что происходит сейчас с этой энергетической, очень важной составляющей на Украине. Потому что, по нашему мнению, по мнению наших специалистов, а они не хуже, чем на Украине, потому что это когда‑то был единый комплекс, как известно, во времена Советского Союза, мы прекрасно себе отдаём отчёт в том, что там происходит. Для того чтобы обеспечить бесперебойные поставки в Европу, нужно закачать необходимый объём в подземные хранилища. Не для внутреннего потребления, а для обеспечения транзита. Вот в чём технологический смысл того, что было сделано ещё во времена Советского Союза.
Газа закачано мало, недостаточно. В принципе от 17 до 21 миллиарда должно быть закачено в подземное хранилище, закачано только, по‑моему, четырнадцать, и более того, сейчас уже начался отбор оттуда. Это вызывает определённые опасения. Мы с Президентом Украины по его инициативе обсуждали вопрос с газоснабжением Украины. Он задал вопрос, может ли Россия возобновить поставки. Конечно, может в любую секунду. Для этого ничего не нужно.
У нас есть контракт, есть дополнение к нему. Нужно только одно – предоплата. И на тот объём денег, которые будут предоплачены, мы точно и гарантированно будем осуществлять поставки наших энергоносителей для потребителей Украины. Но сегодня цена для Украины, а мы договорились об этом раньше, мы сказали об этом раньше, ещё в прошлом году, будет не выше, хочу это подчеркнуть, не выше, чем у соседних государств, в частности для Польши.
Сейчас самой актуальной ценовой ситуации не знаю, но на момент нашего разговора Польша у нас по тем договорным обязательствам, которые есть и которые действуют, покупала газ где‑то по 185, по 184 доллара за тысячу кубов. Украине мы могли бы продавать за 180. Я эту цену назвал – 180 долларов за 1 тысячу кубов. Но нам сказали, что лучше им покупать по реверсу, – пожалуйста. Это, правда, нарушение контрактов между «Газпромом» и его контрагентами в Западной Европе, но мы смотрим на это уже сквозь пальцы, с пониманием.
Если нравится больше по реверсу – пожалуйста, пусть по реверсу покупают, но, насколько мне известно, стоимость газа для конечного потребителя, для промышленных потребителей на Украине сегодня уже превышает 300 долларов за 1 тысячу кубов. Мы предлагаем продавать по 180, но у нас брать пока не хотят. У меня есть основания полагать, что посредники, которые участвуют в этих сделках, покупая по реверсу, видимо, близки сердцу некоторых руководителей в топливно-энергетическом комплексе на Украине. Флаг им в руки, пусть они работают, только главное, чтобы они обеспечили транзит в европейские страны.
Ф.Лукьянов: Владимир Владимирович, в развитие темы, которую Вы и в речи затронули, и потом немножко звучала. Мы все читаем газеты, ведущие мировые журналы, обложки смотрим, тоже очень красивые бывают, наверное, и Вы тоже видите что‑то из этого. Вам приятно чувствовать себя самым опасным и самым могущественным человеком в мире? Это вообще высокая очень оценка ведь.
В.Путин: Вы знаете, мне, конечно, приятно с вами беседовать сегодня, не скрою, и я люблю это дело. Но гораздо более важным считаю прохождение бюджета Российской Федерации через российский парламент, с тем чтобы нам обеспечить воздействие бюджета на решение самых главных вопросов, перед которыми стоит страна. А именно: обеспечение темпов устойчивого роста, необходимых для нашей экономики, решение социальных задач. У нас их огромное количество. Слава богу, нам удаётся сейчас сдерживать инфляцию, которая у нас будет в этом году, надеюсь, все эксперты так говорят, ниже шести процентов. У нас дефицит бюджета, надеюсь, не превысит заданных величин, где‑то три процента.
Как вы знаете, у нас кардинальным образом, в разы, уменьшился отток капитала. Разные есть причины на этот счёт, они есть разные, но реально уменьшился этот отток. У нас много нерешённых проблем, перед которыми стоит страна. И только от решения этих проблем, прежде всего в сфере экономики, социальной сфере, зависит внутренняя политическая стабильность и вес России в мире. Вот я о чём думаю, а не о каком‑то мифическом могуществе.
Т.Колтон: Мы работаем уже два с половиной часа. Мне как модератору надо Вам задать вопрос. Сколько у Вас остаётся резерва времени и терпения? Ваше решение.
В.Путин: Я пришёл сюда, чтобы пообщаться с аудиторией. Вы здесь руководите процессом…
Т.Колтон: Я местный президент, можно сказать.
В.Путин: Я готов подчиниться тому регламенту, который Вы здесь будете продвигать. Пожалуйста.
Т.Колтон: Давайте, работаем ещё полчаса. Он готов. Хорошо.
В таком случае у меня ещё список желающих задать вопросы. Я попытаюсь внести в него обновления.
Следующий выступающий Юрий Слёзкин, Калифорния.
Ю.Слёзкин: Как Вы думаете, какие темы будут главными в главе «Путинская эпоха» в будущих учебниках русской истории? То есть эти учебники уже пишутся, эти главы уже некоторые начинают писать. Некоторые называют Вас строителем государства, преобразователем, централизатором и сравнивают с Екатериной, Петром и другими.
Некоторые считают Вас по большей части консерватором и охранителем. Некоторые делят Ваше правление на два периода: первый – строительство и укрепление государства, и второй период – реакции. И в этом смысле сравнивают Вас со Сталиным и Иваном Грозным среди прочих. Как Вы себе представляете эту главу будущего учебника?
И если я могу ещё задать вопрос, имеющий к первому вопросу отношение: о ком и о чём, по‑Вашему, будет следующая глава? Потому что у нас тут два дня назад Вячеслав Володин повторил своё утверждение двухлетней давности о том, что нет Путина – нет России. И это, мне кажется, подчёркивает важность одного из основных вопросов любой политической системы – вопроса о механизме наследования власти, механизме преемственности. О механизме, который в русской истории очень редко работал гладко и предсказуемо. Что, по‑Вашему, нужно сделать, чтобы следующая глава в нашем учебнике русской истории не называлась «Смутное время»?
В.Путин: На Екатерину я точно не похож по гендерному признаку.
Что касается того главного, о чём, мне кажется, будет интересно узнать будущим исследователям русской истории: главное заключается в том, как нам удалось добиться сплочённости российского общества и русского народа, объединить всех вокруг решения общенациональной задачи. А позволю себе вернуться в ещё советскую историографию и всё‑таки подчеркнуть, что при всей важности личности в истории всё‑таки реальным творцом являются сами люди, сами граждане страны.
А на Ваш вопрос о том, в отношении кого и в отношении чего можно будет писать следующую главу, на это тоже ответят люди, в отношении того, кого они выберут, и в отношении того, что эти люди вместе с будущим руководством страны сделают.
Вопрос: Добрый день! Вашингтонское отделение Международного института стратегических исследований. У меня три конкретных нефилософских вопроса.
В.Путин: Вы шпион?
Реплика: Нет. (Смех.)
В.Путин: А кто же тогда?
Реплика: Учёный.
В.Путин: Нет, я здесь ничего плохого не вижу. Ладно, потом я расскажу историю про одного крупного очень известного политического деятеля в США, которого я очень уважаю и очень люблю. У нас с ним был такой интересный разговор на этот счёт.
Пожалуйста, извините.
Вопрос: У меня вопрос по поводу договора об РСМД. Сейчас он испытывает большие трудности, как Вы знаете; есть много громких взаимных обвинений и так далее. И в этом контексте очень важно понимать общий подход России к этому договору. Есть ли ценность для России в этом договоре – если да, то какая? И вообще стоит ли этот договор сохранить?
В.Путин: Он представил бы очень большую ценность для нас, если бы нашему с Соединёнными Штатами примеру последовали другие страны. Ведь что получилось: наивное бывшее российское руководство пошло на то, чтобы ликвидировать ракеты средней дальности наземного базирования. Американцы ликвидировали «Першинги», мы – ракеты СС-20, их порезали. Была в этой связи известная трагедия, которая связана с тем, что главный конструктор этих систем покончил жизнь самоубийством, посчитал, что это предательство национальных интересов и одностороннее разоружение.
Почему одностороннее? А потому что по этому соглашению мы наземный комплекс порезали, но это соглашение не затронуло ракет средней дальности, расположенных на море и в воздухе. Воздушного и морского базирования (это соглашение ракетно-воздушного и морского базирования) это соглашение не коснулось. У Советского Союза их просто не было, а Соединённые Штаты их оставили на вооружении.
Но получилась явная диспропорция: Соединённые Штаты оказались вооружены ракетами средней дальности – какая разница, они на море находятся, в воздухе тем более или на суше; а Советский Союз просто лишил себя этого вида оружия. Тем более что соседние наши государства – вот в Штатах никто из соседей Соединённых Штатов такое оружие не производят: ни Канада, ни Мексика, а у нас соседние страны почти всё производят: и страны на востоке наших границ, и на Ближнем Востоке, и так далее – кругом. Поэтому для нас это особое испытание, но тем не менее мы считаем необходимым соблюдать это соглашение. Тем более, как вы знаете, у нас тоже сейчас появилось такое же оружие – ракета средней дальности морского и воздушного базирования.
Т.Колтон: Я передаю слово господину Тайсу Кею, Токио.
Тайс Кей: Токийский фонд, Япония. Наконец‑то в сентябре объявлена дата Вашего визита в Японию: это 15 декабря. И сейчас идут интенсивные переговоры о подготовке к этому. Уверен, что ваш визит окажет большой толчок к укреплению отношений между Японией и Россией.
В связи с этим у меня такой вопрос. Накануне Вашей встречи с Премьер-министром Абэ во Владивостоке Вы дали интервью, что нынешнего состояния атмосферы между Японией и Россией недостаточно для подписания мирного договора. У меня такой вопрос: Вы сохраняете такую же оценку сейчас? И если это так, то насколько реалистично ожидать создания атмосферы, которая позволит Японии и России подписать мировой договор в ближайшем будущем – я имею в виду в течение двух, трёх, четырёх лет?
В.Путин: Вы знаете, это тот случай, где, на мой взгляд, нельзя, невозможно и даже вредно определять какие‑то сроки. Скажем, мы с Китайской Народной Республикой вели переговоры по территориальным вопросам на границе в течение 40 лет. И мы договорились окончательно и подписали соответствующее соглашение, в том числе, а может быть, прежде всего потому, что мы с Китаем достигли беспрецедентного уровня сотрудничества, который мы называем больше, чем стратегическим партнёрством – привилегированное стратегическое партнёрство. Так и есть, очень большая степень доверия. И конечно, к сожалению, наши отношения с Японией такого качества ещё не достигли. Но это не значит, что мы не можем этого сделать. Более того, на мой взгляд, и Япония, и Россия заинтересованы в окончательном урегулировании вообще всех вопросов, потому что это соответствует нашим взаимным национальным интересам. Мы этого хотим, мы к этому стремимся.
Когда это будет сделано, как это будет сделано и будет ли сделано вообще, я сейчас ответить не могу. Это вопрос, который мы должны решать вместе, и опираясь на то, что уже было достигнуто в прежние времена, и, конечно, главным образом посматривая в будущее. Я очень рассчитываю, что наши МИДы, наши эксперты внесут в это достойный вклад, и мы сможем на это опереться.
О.Москателли: Вице-министр иностранных дел Богданов нам сказал, что если Ливия или Ирак попросят помощь России против терроризма, Вы будете принимать это серьёзно во внимание. Скажите нам, пожалуйста, на самом деле возможна новая практически военная российская интервенция на Ближнем Востоке, и думаете ли Вы, что это могло бы помочь разрешить проблемы в регионе или наоборот?
В.Путин: А что вы понимаете под словом «интервенция»? Это незаконное или законное участие, что?
О.Москателли: Помощь против терроризма – значит, либо нанести удар… Я не знаю, как Вы на это смотрите, но если принимать серьёзно во внимание, значит, какая‑то, может быть, интервенция, это неправильное слово, но акция военная точно.
В.Путин: Я понял. Нет, мы ничего подобного нигде не планируем.
К.Затулин: Владимир Владимирович, на дискуссии, которая у нас была здесь по Сирии, я задал вопрос Клиффорду Капчану, на который он не ответил. Я сказал о том, что мы пришли в Ближний Восток, в Сирию в том числе для того, чтобы помочь в чувствительном для Запада вопросе борьбы с терроризмом, но сейчас наблюдаем двойные стандарты, когда дело касается операции в Алеппо и операции в Мосуле.
И вопрос мой заключался в том, достигли бы мы победы во Второй мировой войне, если бы всё время любые действия на советско-германском фронте сопровождались бы обвинениями в том, что мы неправильно воюем, со стороны наших союзников, а в свою очередь мы бы обвиняли их в том, что они неправильно воюют на Тихом океане. Вопрос о двойных стандартах, и даже не связанный с Мосулом и Алеппо – с другой территорией. В Сирии нас убеждают, что надо иметь в виду всегда точку зрения оппозиции: она уважаемая, её приглашают в Лозанну, в Женеву и так далее.
Когда дело касается переговоров по Украине, то мы ведём переговоры в формате «нормандской четвёрки», но официально в переговорах никогда не участвуют ДНР и ЛНР. Это непризнанные государства, но это сторона конфликта. Почему она не признаётся стороной конфликта? Это то, что происходит в Приднестровье, то, что было в Абхазии, в Осетии и так далее. Можно ли этого добиться и нужно ли?
В.Путин: Это даже не вопрос – это констатация печального факта, согласно которому нарушаются вообще принципы урегулирования конфликтов, когда, конечно, должны непосредственное участие в выработке решений принимать конфликтующие стороны. Первое.
И, второе, это нарушение самих договорённостей в Минске, потому что там предусмотрено, что напрямую диалог будет. Ведь Минские соглашения подписаны как раз представителями Донецкой и Луганской народных республик. Украинская сторона настаивала на том, чтобы там стояли подписи руководителей этих республик. Мы эти подписи получили, а теперь с ними отказываются разговаривать. Даже логики в этом нет никакой. Это, конечно, контрпродуктивно. Вот и всё, вот и весь комментарий.
Давайте мы всё‑таки дадим слово нашим иностранным друзьям. Попрошу наших российских коллег не обижаться, всё‑таки наши гости приехали издалека, давайте им дадим слово. Пожалуйста.
Вопрос (как переведено): Для меня большая честь быть приглашённым сюда уже шестой раз подряд. У меня очень простой вопрос. Все мы представляем разные страны мира, у нас разное мнения насчёт того, что Вы делаете, у нас разное мнение насчёт внешней политики России. Но Вы приезжаете сюда для глубоких обсуждений с нами, Вы проводите с нами большое количество времени. Мы знаем, что у Вас очень плотное расписание, Вы один из самых занятых, наверное, людей. Поэтому мой вопрос: зачем Вы сюда приезжаете, зачем Вы с нами разговариваете? Я знаю, что Вы единственный лидер, который таким образом обменивается мнением с представителями интеллектуальной элиты со всего мира. В чём выгода лично для Вас? Как Вы можете содействовать национальным интересам России здесь и за пределами?
В.Путин: Две задачи. Первая – послушать умных людей, экспертов. Мне реально интересно ваше мнение, это полезно и для меня, и для моих коллег. И второе – донести до вас и через вас нашу точку зрения из первых уст. Вот и всё. Я считаю, что это важно.
Пожалуйста.
Вопрос (как переведено): Спасибо, господин Президент.
Мне неважно, зачем Вы здесь, но я очень благодарна Вам, что Вы здесь. Думаю, для нас большая честь, что Вы здесь присутствуете.
Мой вопрос касается отношений с США. Критика США в Вашем выступлении была гораздо менее резкой, чем несколько лет назад, но я не думаю, что кто‑либо здесь был бы удивлён тому, что большая часть критики была направлена на США.
Когда я слушала Ваше выступление о выборах в США, о нашем поведении, я не могла не думать о заголовке в США, когда будет опубликована запись наших обсуждений. Хочу Вам рассказать о тех заметках, которые я сделала.
Люди в Америке говорят: действительно ли российский лидер верит, что описание американского политического процесса, которое он представил, выдвигается для того, чтобы противодействовать критике, звучащей в Америке, в отношении российского политического процесса, или же это возврат к чему‑то тому, что, на Ваш взгляд, являлось нашей системой, но на самом деле не является? В этом заключается мой вопрос, поскольку Ваше описание нашего избирательного процесса звучит действительно так же, как наше описание вашего избирательного процесса. Это первый вопрос.
Второй вопрос. Описание нарушений международного права, например, в Белграде, звучит точно так же, как наше описание того, что произошло в Крыму. Поэтому хотела бы задать Вам следующий вопрос. Наш диалог с обеих сторон – способствуют ли ему такие описания, которые звучат и с российского телевидения, и с американского телевидения?
У нас есть такое выражение, что, если вы в яме, единственный способ выбраться оттуда – перестать копать эту яму. И поэтому такие односторонние шаги, шаги в отношениях с другими странами, – есть ли какие‑то шаги, которые могли бы быть предприняты, чтобы порвать этот порочный круг, который заключается в том, что мы описываем друг друга таким образом, что не способствуем развитию наших отношений? Мне кажется, без этого перспективы наших отношений, наверное, не очень‑то и светлые.
В.Путин: Да, конечно. Я согласен с Вами в том, что нужно, безусловно, предпринять хотя бы попытку прервать этот порочный круг. Но не мы его начали чертить, этот круг. Мы‑то, наоборот, открылись полностью в середине 1990-х годов.
Мы ожидали, что это будет равноправный диалог, что будут учитываться наши интересы, мы сможем дискутировать, в чём‑то идти навстречу друг другу. Но нельзя же решать все вопросы в одностороннем порядке, и всё. И любой ценой добиваться своих целей.
Вот Вы привели пример бомбардировок, скажем, бывшей Югославии, Белграда и Крыма. Спасибо Вам за такой пример, просто замечательный пример. Бомбардировки Белграда – вот это и есть интервенция в обход норм и правил международного права. Разве Совет Безопасности ООН принимал решение о военной интервенции в Югославии? Нет. Соединённые Штаты сделали это в одностороннем порядке.
Вы сейчас мне скажете, Вы сказали: в Крыму. А что в Крыму? Что Вы сделали в Югославии и потом отделили от неё часть государств, в том числе и Косово, а потом от Сербии. В Косово парламент проголосовал после военных действий интервенции, после многочисленных жертв. И всё, решение принято, и все с этим согласились.
В Крыму не было никакой войны. Не было никаких бомбовых ударов, военных действий, жертв нет, вообще ни один человек не погиб. Единственное, что мы сделали, – обеспечили право народа на волеизъявление в полном соответствии, кстати говоря, с уставом Организации Объединённых Наций. И слово в слово почти всё то же самое сделали, что вы сделали по Косово, только чуть больше.
В Косово парламент принял решение об отделении, а здесь люди пришли на референдум и на референдуме сказали своё мнение. А затем парламент это решение парафировал и уже как независимое государство обратился в Россию с целью воссоединения.
Конечно, можно сколько угодно пикироваться, но этот порочный круг надо прервать. Я много раз говорил об этом, хочу ещё раз сказать. Югославия, потом Ирак, я же вам говорил, потом Ливия, Афганистан, движение НАТО – это что? А потом каждый раз что‑то забывается, выбрасывается, нас на что‑то провоцируют, на какие‑то действия по защите своих интересов, а потом говорят: вот злобная Россия предпринимает такие‑то и такие‑то шаги. Так вы нас не провоцируйте на это, не провоцируйте нас на активную защиту своих интересов. Давайте мы с вами будем договариваться о чём‑то. Договориться же ни о чём невозможно. А о чём договариваемся – не выполняется.
Мне очень хотелось бы, чтобы с новой администрацией у нас сложились другие отношения – отношения партнёрства и учёта взаимных интересов.
О.Антоненко: Владимир Владимирович, если позволите, небольшую ремарку и потом вопрос. Ремарка такая: Вы в ответе на вопрос Фёдора Лукьянова сказали, что для Вас более важным является то, что происходит в России: принятие бюджета, реформы, – чем внешняя политика; поэтому она касается именно этого – того, что происходит в России.
Мы с Всемирным банком проводим каждые пять лет опросы во всех странах переходной экономики и странах бывшего Советского Союза, и в Восточной Европе, теперь в Турции и на Ближнем Востоке. И последний опрос только что закончился, и в том числе там был вопрос о том, как люди воспринимают своё положение.
И очень интересные данные по России. 30 процентов людей с самым низким доходом в России: их отношение к своей жизни за последние пять лет никоим образом не уменьшилось – наоборот, в чём‑то немного увеличилась. Это несмотря на инфляцию, несмотря на падение реального дохода, несмотря на всё, что произошло за последние три года. Но зато у тех людей, которые представляют 30 процентов наибольшего дохода, падение почти 30 процентов. Это самое большое среди всех стран переходного периода. Интересные данные.
Как Вам кажется, Вы не сказали ещё, собираетесь ли Вы баллотироваться в 2018 году, но, если Вы всё‑таки собираетесь, как Вы хотите этой категории людей доказать, что Вы отвечаете их интересам? И не кажется ли Вам, что у них есть запрос, вот то, что Алексей Леонидович Кудрин называл, – на снижение геополитической напряжённости, во‑первых; во‑вторых, на проведение реформ и, в третьих, борьбу с коррупцией.
В.Путин: У нас у всех есть запрос на снижение геополитической напряжённости, только не способом наших похорон. Если плата за то, чтобы снизить геополитическую напряжённость, – наши похороны, то нас никого это не устроит, в том числе и тех, кто проявляет сомнение по поводу эффективности работы действующей власти, или тех, кто хотел бы серьёзных перемен. Таких немало в стране.
По поводу того, о чём Вы сказали, что большинство всё‑таки удовлетворено своим положением. Думаю, что это связано с тем, что у нас всё‑таки на минимальном уровне находится уровень безработицы: он меньше 6 процентов. Если в некоторых европейских странах за 25 зашкаливает, в странах Евросоюза, и больше – у нас в среднем меньше шести. У нас есть свои проблемы, особенно на Кавказе, там с занятостью есть проблема. Это первое.
Второе. Мы всё‑таки стремимся к исполнению своих социальных обязательств, и люди видят это, видят, что, с одной стороны, есть проблемы, но с другой стороны – государство делает всё для того, чтобы обеспечить их интересы. Мы проводим очень взвешенную социальную политику и при этом обеспечиваем макроэкономическую стабильность. Это основа того, что и такой активный слой населения, активный класс, особенно предпринимательское сообщество, может иметь перспективы улучшения ситуации.
Мы сейчас говорили, Вы говорили о геополитической напряжённости. Так мы разве в этом заинтересованы? Нельзя же добиваться от нас того, чего кто‑то хочет, исключительно, хочу это подчеркнуть – исключительно за счёт наших национальных интересов. Всё же к этому сводится. Диалога нет, понимаете, в чём дело. Формулируют позицию, объявляют её правильной, и вся дискуссия сводится к тому, как быстро мы согласимся с этой позицией. Вот и всё. Но разве такая работа возможна? Почти по любому вопросу. А там, где‑то чего‑то обещают, – не выполняют, но делают вид, что не заметили, и дальше пошли.
Вы представляете очень солидный финансовый институт, у нас хорошая предыстория отношений. Почему Вы пошли на поводу у политиков и свернули проекты в России? Это Вам вопрос. Он ведь создавался не для этого, не для того, чтобы усугублять геополитическую напряжённость, а чтобы, наоборот, сглаживать. Но даже такие институты используют для других целей. Это печально, это же не мы придумали.
В отношении этих ограничений – никому не нравится; это, конечно, вызывает наши озабоченности, это мешает нашему развитию, но мне кажется, я уже об этом говорил, что, даже если бы не было этих проблем, связанных с Украиной, с юго-востоком, с Крымом, с Сирией, всё равно нашли бы что‑нибудь другое для сдерживания России. Потому что не нравится наша независимая позиция по ряду вопросов – надо поднажать, надо заставить, надо мобилизовать ресурсы. Что‑то не сделали наши американские партнёры по сирийской проблеме (им даже неудобно, они же знают, что они не сделали, договорённости не использовали) – раз, подсылают европейцев, давайте поднажмём с другой стороны. Это не способ решения проблем.
Вот эти ограничения. Некоторые западные эксперты считают, что где‑то у нас серьёзные потери. Я думаю, что это преувеличение. Да, Вы согласны со мной, я понимаю. Считают, 0,5 процента ВВП. Я думаю, что это не так.
Сами европейские страны потеряли экспорт в Россию в объёме почти 60 миллиардов долларов или евро, не помню, где‑то 58 с чем‑то. Вот недополученная выгода от реального нормального сотрудничества. У нас‑то потери в основном связаны с падением цен на нефть, потом к ним привязаны цены на газ, а к этому привязаны цены на производство химических продуктов, удобрений, нефтехимии и так далее, и так далее. Там целая цепочка возникает. Поэтому прежде всего вот это на нас действует.
Хотя финансовые ограничения тоже вредны, они вызывают определённую нервозность у инвесторов. Это и не нравится тем 30 процентам, о которых Вы сказали. И мне не нравится. А кому может понравиться? Мы будем работать над тем, чтобы этого не было. Надо только, чтобы это была дорога с двусторонним движением.
Пожалуйста.
А.Островский: Господин Президент, за последние 15 лет Россия очень сильно продвинулась в смысле экономики. Её экономика выросла с 1 триллиона до 3,5 триллиона рублей, и Россия стала страной с доходом выше среднего. Появился очень мощный, экономически мощный средний класс и выросло первое постсоветское поколение: те, кому сегодня 25, родились в том самом 1991 году. Некоторых из них мы видели на протестах в Москве в 2011–2012 годах. Считаете ли Вы, что для дальнейшего успешного развития российской экономики нужна смена политической и экономической модели в стране? Это первый вопрос.
И второй вопрос. На Западе огромную озабоченность вызывает всё, что касается, естественно, ядерного оружия. И, когда по российским государственным каналам звучат слова о том, что Америку можно превратить в ядерный пепел (которые не звучали даже в советское время), считаете ли Вы использование самой риторики, касающейся ядерного вооружения, приемлемой?
В.Путин: Первое, что касается перемен: перемены всегда нужны, без этого наступает стагнация, – вопрос, каким способом осуществляются эти перемены. Или революционным, и это, как правило, наносит только вред. И я считаю, что часть людей, которых Вы сейчас упомянули, – иных уж нет, как у нас говорят, а те далече, – даже если предположить, что они хотели лучшего, способ достижения этих целей неправильный и вредный. Нужен эволюционный процесс. И я очень рассчитываю на то, что мы и будем двигаться этим способом, эволюционным.
Сейчас не буду вдаваться в детали, у нас просто уже формат не позволяет, но мы над этим думаем. У нас и Центр стратегических разработок функционирует, и мы привлекаем экспертов самых разных. Думаем на тему о том, как мы будем развиваться и до президентских выборов, и после 2018 года.
И по поводу атомного оружия. Бряцать атомным оружием – самое последнее дело. Это вредная риторика, и я её не приветствую. Но надо исходить из реалий, исходить из того, что ядерное оружие является фактором сдерживания и фактором обеспечения мира и безопасности во всём мире. Нельзя его рассматривать как фактор какой бы то ни было потенциальной агрессии, потому что это невозможно, это означает конец вообще существования всей нашей цивилизации, наверное.
Но как фактор сдерживания, это совершенно очевидная вещь, имеет место быть, и многие эксперты считают, что если мир не знал крупных вооружённых конфликтов 70 лет с лишним после окончания Второй мировой войны, то это в том числе благодаря наличию у ведущих стран мира ядерного оружия. Важно только, чтобы соблюдались режимы нераспространения, касающиеся самого ядерного оружия, средств доставки и чтобы все ядерные державы относились очень ответственно к своему ядерному статусу. Россия будет придерживаться именно таких подходов, несмотря ни на какие заявления, которые в ходе полемики, конечно, наверное, могут где‑то звучать. Но, повторяю, на государственном уровне Россия всегда к своему ядерному статусу будет относиться очень ответственно.
Кстати говоря, Вы дали мне повод для того, чтобы сказать о том, что, когда наши американские партнёры в одностороннем порядке вышли из Договора по противоракетной обороне (напомню, что я сейчас скажу, это очень важно), мы сказали, что поскольку мы сейчас не готовы развивать такие системы, они неизвестно как будут работать, насколько они эффективны, но это вынуждает нас совершенствовать ударный системный комплекс. На что нам наши американские друзья ответили: «Делайте что хотите, потому что система ПРО, которую мы будем делать, не против вас, а мы будем исходить из того, что то, что вы делаете по ударным комплексам, – не против нас». Я сказал: «Хорошо, пошло». И мы работаем. Но таким образом всё‑таки, хотят этого или не хотят, но мы подтолкнули в известной степени гонку вооружений даже в этой сфере. Повторяю, главное, чтобы все относились к этому очень ответственно. Россия будет это делать.
Т.Колтон: Мы уже переступили через 3-часовой порог, и думаю, что наши четыре панелиста, конечно, здесь участвовали все, но господин Путин, наверно, поработал больше остальных. Хочу поблагодарить всех за вопросы, за работу. Уверен, что вопросов ещё осталось очень много, но это обсуждение было очень полезным.
Большое всем спасибо.
В.Путин: Я хочу тоже всех поблагодарить, большое спасибо, и всех моих коллег – за терпение, за участие. Благодарю вас.
Владимир В. Путин"
"title: Awakened Humanity Awaits Fully Scripted Ending As Controversial Election Day Nears author: Bernie Suarez text: in: Consciousness , Government Corruption , Society , Special Interests , US News No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We’ve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their “democracy” tactics using “special forces”, NGO’s, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson’s disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We’ve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I’m understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. That’s right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media “stories” and narratives unless we could “prove” that the account didn’t happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a “conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged “ political terrorism “, a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this “terrorism” or planned “event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many “events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today’s events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what’s coming this November 8th 2016. What’s coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they’ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I’ll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs) 2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let’s not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done. 3- Don’t rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don’t assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don’t discount that some “news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn’t ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it’s kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. And so today I’m thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no “political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. Finally, I’m reminded of the very last line of the film ‘ The American Dream ‘ when the villain asks “what do you think this is?” and the answer “this is AMERICA!!”. Likewise, let’s remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. Submit your review"

"title: Biden: I have ‘no intention’ of accepting a post in a Hillary White House author: LU Staff text: Print 
For those who were hoping or dreading the continued presence of Crazy Joe Biden in a presidential administration after the Barack Obamas belatedly leave the White House, the loose-lipped 73-year-old has confirmed that the nation won’t have Joe Biden to kick around any more. 
Biden, who was rumored to be on Hillary Clinton’s short list for secretary of state and prior to that was being groomed as a late contender for the Democratic Party nomination in the event Clinton failed to carry California in the primary, told a Minnesota radio station Friday he has “no intention” of serving in Hillary Clinton’s administration as secretary of state or in any other role. 
“I don’t want to remain in the administration.… I have no intention of staying involved,” Biden told Minnesota radio station KBJR . 
He added, though, that he wanted to “help [Clinton] if I can in any way I can.” 
It’s not clear whether Biden’s lack of interest is absolute, or if he could be talked into serving as secretary of state despite his doubts.

"title: Washington War Party Urges Obama to Go to War Against Assad & the Russians - Christoph Germann author: nan text: Washington War Party Urges Obama to Go to War Against Assad & the Russians 
Clinton fans call on Obama to “save Aleppo” as NATO-GCC-backed ‘rebels’ prepare new offensive Originally appeared at Newsbud 
On October 21, The Washington Post published a noteworthy op-ed titled “Bring Syria’s Assad and his backers to account now,” written by retired U.S. Marine General John Allen and self-proclaimed Syria expert Charles Lister. Allen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and serves on the board of advisors of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) cutout. The retired four-star general attracted a lot of attention earlier this year when he delivered a forceful endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. 
Lister was formerly a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar and is now a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, which describes itself as “an unbiased source of information and analysis” on the Middle East and partners with corporations such as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco. Lister has dismissed conflict of interest allegations by saying his contact with the Syrian opposition “had absolutely nothing to do with Qatar” and stressing that his “work on this is 100% funded by Western govts.”[1] 
Allen and Lister harshly criticize U.S. “inaction” in Syria in their October 21 op-ed, emphasizing that “the Assad clique and its backers must be brought to account before it is too late.” 
The authors’ case rests on the premise that U.S. policy in Syria has been characterized by inaction and “has never sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground.”[2] 
Since the beginning of the conflict, advocates of greater U.S. military involvement have tried to promote the myth of “U.S. inaction in Syria.” 
Even after U.S. media disclosed the existence of a CIA weapons supply and training program in summer 2012, efforts to promote this myth continued unabated. 
In early 2013, about eight months after The Washington Post first reported that the United States is coordinating the flow of weapons to the so-called “Syrian rebels,”[3] the editorial board of The Washington Post warned of the “consequences of U.S. inaction in Syria,” accusing the Obama administration of not doing enough to support the “rebels.”[4] 
Neither The Washington Post nor any other major media outlet in the United States has been willing to publicize the true extent of U.S. covert operations in Syria, which started as early as April-May 2011.[5] 
From the very beginning, U.S. policy sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground in favor of the foreign-backed anti-Assad opposition. But instead of exposing the U.S.-led war on Syria, the media has been feeding into the false narrative of “U.S. inaction in Syria.” 
Referring to this narrative, Allen and Lister call for accelerating and broadening the provision of lethal and nonlethal assistance to “vetted moderate opposition groups.”[6] 
The United States’ vetting process of militias plays a central role in all of Lister’s policy proposals.[7] What Lister fails to mention is that this vetting process consists of nothing more than trace searches in old databases and half-hearted interviews. U.S. Special Forces soldiers on the ground in Turkey and Jordan told SOFREP that many “rebels” had sympathies with terrorist groups but knew exactly how to sell themselves during such interviews.[8] 
As U.S. Special Forces soldiers on the ground voice their indignation over a mission that nobody believes in because they are just training the next generation of jihadis, Allen and Lister want to increase U.S. assistance to “vetted” groups in order to “save Aleppo,” which has become the focal point of the Syrian conflict: 
“For a start, the United States must save Aleppo. Damascus, Moscow and Tehran are razing the city to prepare for an eventual ground assault. As both the CIA and Pentagon have concluded, an opposition loss in Aleppo would severely undermine the United States’ counterterrorism objectives in Syria. The city’s symbolism and strategic value are unmatched, and allowing it to fall would dramatically empower extremist narratives. Groups linked to al-Qaeda would reap the rewards of our shortcomings.”[9] 
At the beginning of October, just hours after the U.S. suspended talks with Russia over Syria, The Washington Post reported that the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are pressuring President Obama to approve “kinetic actions” against Syrian government forces, arguing that an opposition loss in Aleppo “would undermine America’s counterterrorism goals in Syria.”[10] 
Given the fact that the opposition in “rebel-held” eastern Aleppo is led by Jabhat al-Nusra, this argument seems rather dubious.[11] Despite rebranding itself as “Jabhat Fatah al-Sham” and supposedly cutting its ties with al-Qaeda, the group is still considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Another group present in eastern Aleppo, Ahrar al-Sham, is also closely tied to al-Qaeda.[12] 
It is not exactly clear why “groups linked to al-Qaeda would reap the rewards” if groups linked to al-Qaeda are defeated in eastern Aleppo or why their defeat “would severely undermine the United States’ counterterrorism objectives in Syria.” 
If Allen and Lister want to stop empowering extremist narratives, they could start by revising their portrayal of the battle of Aleppo and the Syrian conflict in general. 
Nusra and its allies are not defending civilians in eastern Aleppo, as frequently claimed, but holding them hostage in order to maintain a foothold in the strategic city, which was invaded by “rebels” in summer 2012 after refusing to join the uprising. 
As soon as Syrian government forces and their allies first managed to encircle the “rebel-held” areas of Aleppo in July of this year, they announced the opening of humanitarian passages for civilians and surrendering fighters. According to the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), only “around 12 people managed to use the Bustan al-Qasr corridor before rebel groups reinforced security measures and prevented families from approaching the corridors.”[13] 
Instead of telling the “rebel groups” in eastern Aleppo to stop holding civilians hostage, the United States and its allies supported a major offensive led and organized by al-Nusra to break the siege and “put some pressure back on Russia and Iran.” 
One Western diplomat tried to play down the outside support, saying: 
“The rebels’ problem has never been a lack of weapons. This was internally planned, and it succeeded not because of outside support but because Fatah al-Sham and the other jihadi groups are incredibly disciplined, with plenty of guys willing to blow themselves up at the front.”[14] 
Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham and other involved groups referred to the Aleppo offensive as the “Ibrahim al-Youssef battle,” a reference to the Syrian army officer who led the Aleppo Artillery School Massacre in the late 1970s. 
In June 1979, Ibrahim al-Youssef and members of a Muslim Brotherhood splinter group killed dozens of Alawite cadets after separating them from their Sunni colleagues. During the July-August Aleppo offensive, a spokesman for the Nusra-led forces said they would continue what Ibrahim al-Youssef had started and kill the Alawites.[15] 
Ibrahim al-Youssef’s son Yasser is a political representative for the U.S.-vetted “rebel group” Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki, which participates in the battle of Aleppo and lately joined the Nusra-led military alliance Jaish al-Fatah. Zinki is probably best known for beheading a child captive on camera. The group reportedly lost U.S. backing in August or September of last year and was in talks with the U.S. over the restoration of its support when the incriminating footage emerged.[16] 
Yasser al-Youssef has become the media’s go-to-guy for information about the “rebels” in and around Aleppo. After the Syrian government and its Russian allies recently announced a unilateral cease-fire to allow civilians and surrendering fighters once again to leave eastern Aleppo, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Yasser al-Youssef as saying that opposition fighters wanted “nothing to do” with the Russian initiative and asking: “Who are they to decide to displace the Syrian people who rebelled against the dictator Assad?”[17] 
Meanwhile, the Associated Press (AP) quoted Zinki’s al-Youssef as saying that the opposition had agreed to the initiative to evacuate wounded and allow in aid. According to al-Youssef, the evacuations didn’t materialize because the Syrian government and Russia gave no assurances the wounded would not face arrest.[18] 
As both sides were blaming each other for the breakdown, Western journalists on the ground confirmed that “rebels” were firing on the checkpoints and exit corridors, making it extremely dangerous for anyone to leave eastern Aleppo.[19] 
When Allen and Lister say “the United States must save Aleppo,” they are not referring to the civilians in eastern Aleppo who are being held hostage by the “rebels” or to the civilians in western Aleppo who are being killed by indiscriminate “rebel” shelling. They are referring to al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Zinki and other “rebel groups” in eastern Aleppo. 
On the same day the Allen-Lister op-ed was published, Lister gleefully announced on Twitter that Ahrar al-Sham, Zinki and allied militias are preparing another offensive to break the siege of Aleppo. Nusra will of course join the fight, but “the impetus and most of the planning for this offensive largely excluded” the terrorist group, as the PR disaster during the July-August offensive is still fresh on everyone’s mind. “Regional states have provided substantial support to buttress the offensive,” according to Lister.[20] 
U.S. allies Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar already provided substantial support to buttress the July-August Aleppo offensive – with the full blessing of the United States.[21] Washington’s primary objective was to put some pressure back on Russia and Iran, not to save civilians. As before, the new offensive is going to prompt an adequate response from Russia and its allies, thereby prolonging the suffering of civilians in Aleppo. 
With current U.S. policy leading nowhere, the Obama administration is divided over Syria. Whereas the hawks around CIA director John Brennan and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter want to escalate the conflict, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are increasingly skeptical of such plans. 
Obama is reportedly not willing to approve plans to supply CIA-vetted militias with more powerful weapons. 
One senior U.S. official told The Washington Post that CIA-backed units are “not doing any better on the battlefield, they’re up against a more formidable adversary, and they’re increasingly dominated by extremists,” raising the question of whether the program can accomplish anything beyond adding to the carnage in Syria.[22] 
The Lister-approved vetting process is apparently not working. 
Moreover, the sceptics in the administration fear that the new weaponry could end up killing Russian military personnel and they want to avoid risking a confrontation with Russia. 
But not everyone shares this opinion. 
Due to his reluctance to escalate the conflict in Syria, Obama has alienated Washington’s foreign policy establishment, which favors more U.S. military action, including cruise missile strikes on Syrian government forces.[23] 
That is also a key point of the Allen-Lister plan. 
When The Washington Post first reported on U.S. plans to target Syrian government forces, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov stressed that Russian troops were now widely deployed across Syria, implying that any such attack would run the risk of killing Russian soldiers.[24] 
Allen and Lister are of course aware of this risk. Explaining how to punish cease-fire violations by Syrian government forces with U.S. military action, they note in passing: 
“We should expect the possible intentional co-mingling of Syrian and Russian forces and assets as a deterrent. While this may complicate targeting strategies, we should not miss the opportunity to hit offending Syrian elements and units, while sustaining counter-Islamic State operations elsewhere.”[25] 
Neither Allen and Lister nor Washington’s foreign policy elite seem to mind risking a direct military confrontation with Russia. But President Obama and other sceptics in the administration don’t want to start World War III over Syria, as one senior administration official who is involved in Middle East policy emphasized: 
“You can’t pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against the Russians.”[26] 
While the war party in Washington is waiting for Obama to leave office, Russia is preparing for a showdown in Syria with the largest surface deployment since the end of the Cold War.[27] 
As Allen and Lister point out, the war party “cannot wait for a new administration in Washington” because “events are moving too quickly.”[28] They may have lost Aleppo by the time Hillary Clinton takes office.[28] 
So Obama might have to deal with more “accidents,” such as the September 17 Deir Ezzor attack, during his last months as President of the United States.

"title: Olympic Legend Michael Phelps Was Married When He Took Rio by Storm, and the World Had No Idea author: Virginia Kruta text: Share on Twitter 
Michael Phelps left the Rio Olympics on a high note. He was retiring on his own terms at the pinnacle of a record-shattering career in the pool. He had his new son Boomer — born this past May — and his fiancee, Nicole Johnson , was busy planning their wedding. 
She told Cosmopolitan in late August that, because of the Olympics, she was taking on all of the wedding planning: 
""I took on everything, obviously, because he had to focus on going to the games. And now I'm like, 'What do you think about this and what do you think about that?' I know Michael well enough to know he doesn't need to partake in the tiny, minuscule decisions. 
But I also know him well enough to know that he does want to be involved in what flavor our cake is going to be and what flowers he thinks are ugly and what flowers he thinks are really pretty."" 
But TMZ is now saying that it was all a ruse — that Johnson was talking a good game about plans for a wedding that had already happened in secret. 
According to TMZ's report, Phelps and Johnson actually tied the knot in Arizona on June 13th , after obtaining a marriage license just a few days prior. 
Johnson posted a rather unassuming photo that day: A photo posted by Nicole Michele Johnson (@nicole.m.johnson) on Jun 13, 2016 at 10:43pm PDT 
Despite that, as recently as four weeks ago, Phelps was still playing along: A photo posted by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Aug 28, 2016 at 11:28pm PDT 
And two weeks ago, Johnson was posting about bridal gown choices: A photo posted by Nicole Michele Johnson (@nicole.m.johnson) on Oct 7, 2016 at 5:27pm PDT A photo posted by Nicole Michele Johnson (@nicole.m.johnson) on Oct 8, 2016 at 1:02pm PDT 
And looking back, Johnson may have foreshadowed a little something in recent interviews. She told “ Access Hollywood ” that the wedding was “taken care of,” though it seems they may still be planning a post-wedding celebration for family and friends: 
“It'll be small and intimate for the wedding, and then we're throwing a massive bash for everyone.” 
And in her Cosmopolitan interview , when asked if she thought she'd ever collaborate with Phelps on a professional level, she responded: 
“I would love to. Possibly hosting or reporting of some kind. But right now my main priority is being a wife to Michael and Boomer's mom.” 
The assumption at the time was that she meant “being a wife” in the near future, but it could have just been a slip of the tongue. "
"title: NRA: Elect Senators to Save U.S. From UN Arms Trade Treaty author: Joe Wolverton, II, J.D. text: Email 
On November 4, the National Rifle Association (NRA) called on Americans concerned about the future of the right to keep and bear arms to focus their attention on electing pro-Second Amendment senators in the upcoming federal elections. 
These senators, the NRA explains, will be the last obstacle standing between the United Nation's Arms Trade Treaty's (ATT) forced civilian disarmament and the continuation of gun rights in America. But that’s just the beginning. As you know, the U.S. Senate also ratifies international treaties. Right now, at the United Nations, the Arms Trade Treaty — which could subject American gun owners to international gun registration, monitoring and global gun-control “norms” that would be defined on the fly — is just waiting, like unexploded ordnance, for an anti-gun U.S. Senate to call it in. Under President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry signed onto the Arms Trade Treaty. All the treaty needs to become the law of the land is for the U.S. Senate to ratify it. 
While it is certainly wise to fill the Senate (and the House, for that matter) with representatives committed to upholding the Constitution, there are other, surer and more constitutionally sound ways of blocking the unconstitutional confiscation of weapons and ammunition that would be carried out should the UN's Arms Trade Treaty by enforced in the United States. 
The most powerful check citizens of the states have on the seizure of weapons by the UN or its American allies is the nullification of any and all unconstitutional acts of the federal government. 
Nullification is the exercise by states of their retained authority to hold as null, void, and of no legal effect any act of the federal government that exceeds its constitutionally enumerated powers. This availability of this tactic is proclaimed and protected by the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
The NRA is correct, though, that the ATT is so offensive to the preservation of the right to keep and bear arms that it is an understatement to call it unconstitutional. As The New American has reported, several provisions of this treaty significantly diminish the scope of this basic right. 
First, the Arms Trade Treaty grants a monopoly over all weaponry in the hands of the very entity (government) responsible for over 300 million murders in the 20th century. 
Furthermore, the treaty leaves private citizens powerless to oppose future slaughters. 
An irrefutable fact of armed violence unaddressed by the UN in its gun grab is that all the murders committed by all the serial killers in history don't amount to a fraction of the brutal killings committed by ""authorized state parties"" using the very weapons over which they will exercise absolute control under the terms of the Arms Trade Treaty. 
Article 2 of the treaty defines the scope of the treaty’s prohibitions. The right to own, buy, sell, trade, or transfer all means of armed resistance, including handguns, is denied to civilians by this section of the Arms Trade Treaty. 
Article 3 places the “ammunition/munitions fired, launched or delivered by the conventional arms covered under Article 2” within the scope of the treaty’s prohibitions, as well. 
Article 4 rounds out the regulations, also placing all “parts and components” of weapons within the scheme. 
Perhaps the most immediate threat to the rights of gun owners in the Arms Trade Treaty is found in Article 5. Under the title of “General Implementation,” Article 5 mandates that all countries participating in the treaty “shall establish and maintain a national control system, including a national control list.” 
This list should “apply the provisions of this Treaty to the broadest range of conventional arms.” 
Article 12 adds to the record-keeping requirement, mandating that the list include “the quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms,” as well as the identity of the “end users” of these items. 
In very clear terms, ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the United States would require that the U.S. government force gun owners to add their names to the national registry. Citizens would be required to report the amount and type of all firearms and ammunition they possess. 
Section 4 of Article 12 of the treaty requires that the list be kept for at least 10 years. 
Finally, the agreement demands that national governments take “appropriate measures” to enforce the terms of the treaty, including civilian disarmament. If these countries can’t get this done on their own, however, Article 16 provides for UN assistance, specifically including help with the enforcement of “stockpile management, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.” 
In fact, a “voluntary trust fund” will be established to assist those countries that need help from UN peacekeepers or other regional forces to disarm their citizens. 
There is no way that the men and women of the United States can hope to maintain their hard-won liberty — liberty that cost the lives, fortunes, and sacred honor of some of the greatest men of the 18th century — without the ability to put up an armed resistance to tyrants and to their armed enforcers. 
The truth is, though, the Senate — in collusion with the president and the Supreme Court — has shrunk the scope of the Second Amendment despite the fact that the plain language of the Second Amendment explicitly forbids any infringement on this right that protects all others. 
In fact, the reason for inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights had little to do with the British and more to do with future attempts by an out-of-control, all-powerful central authority disarming the American people as a step toward tyranny. 
Take, for example, statements by our forefathers regarding the purpose of the passage of this amendment. In commenting on the Constitution in 1833, Joseph Story wrote: The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them."" 
In his own commentary on the works of the influential jurist Blackstone, Founding-era legal scholar St. George Tucker wrote: This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty.... The right of self defense is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. 
Writing in The Federalist , Alexander Hamilton explained: If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. 
To accomplish this urgent task of protecting this ""true palladium of liberty,"" it would be better if Americans adopted a two-pronged attack on the Arms Trade Treaty, rather than relying alone on senators in Washington, D.C. to stand steadfastly against those who would confiscate the firearms from Americans. 
First, as the NRA suggests, we must elect federal senators who will refuse to ratify the globalists' gun grabbing scheme. 
Second, and perhaps most important and effective, Americans should elect state representatives and governors who will refuse to cooperate with the federal government in any unconstitutional program, particularly one that would leave citizens at the mercy of the government's monopoly on arms that would be created by the enforcement of the Arms Trade Treaty.

"title: Weiner’s Teen Victim Just Called Out Comey For Politicizing Her Abuse author: Grant Stern text: Comments 
The teenager whose explosive allegations led to a federal investigation against disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has published an open letter about victim’s rights, and her utter betrayal by FBI Director James Comey’s partisan memo that is so heart wrenching, that it must be shared and read by every single law enforcement officer in the country, if not the world. 
This entire weekend, intense media coverage has focused on one woman – Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton – most observers believe was wronged by Comey’s intentionally vague memo. All the while, the woman most harmed by FBI Director Comey’s partisan attack has been suffering in silent agony, victimized first by her abuser and then by the men with badges. 
FBI agents claimed that they spoke with her to seek justice, only for Comey to turn around and betray her, to victimize her yet again, by thrusting her story into the white heat of the last week in a bitterly contested general election campaign’s final media feeding frenzy with one vaguely worded memo guaranteed to draw maximum questioning by the press. 
The anonymous teen who only went to the FBI under the promise of anonymity and was grilled by agents for seven hours just last Friday. Only minutes after ending that interrogation, she was contacted by journalists who knew her identity only minutes after ending the discussions with the federal law enforcement officers. 
Clearly, her identity was somehow no longer a secret. The media contacted the teen victim and her family before even the FBI case manager let her know about Comey’s memo, and it all happened before she could escape the public eye to safeguard her privacy. So she wrote this letter and delivered it to a national entertainment website : 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle? 
In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda. 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article. 
I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views. 
— Girl that lost her faith in America 
P.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life! 
It’s impossible to read this letter without tears for the teenage girl who was victimized by Anthony Wiener, and bravely stepped forward to alert the authorities so they could stop a sad sex predator so mentally ill, that after his out of control actions cost him his career and his public image, he continued his behavior until he lost his marriage and perhaps next his freedom for the safety of others. 
Instead, the very authorities at the FBI who pledged to maintain her anonymity and seek justice for her, and to prevent she, and others from facing the same ills, have turned into a political party with badges – and not a very well coordinated group of people with badges either. 
Our nation needs leaders who place their duty above partisan politics, and in law enforcement we need cops on the beat to protect the victims, not to abuse the victims for their own partisan games. 
Our nation needs for FBI Director James Comey to admit his mistakes and vacate his position, before the next victim of crime gets victimized by his unsavory political maneuvering using the country’s top law enforcement agency to slander someone else into political compliance."

"title: Mike Pence ""gay conversion therapy saved my marriage"" author: nan text: By Fink | Leave/Read Comments Vice President-elect Mike Pence claims that a 1983 conversion therapy saved him. 
Indianapolis, IN — In a surprise announcement today, Indiana Governor and Vice President-elect Mike Pence said that gay conversion therapy saved his marriage. The controversial Republican, who was elected the 50th governor of the Hoosier State, has been a long-time proponent of a “Biblical view” on homosexuality and as a member of Congress stated that the legislative branch “should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a ‘discrete and insular minority’ entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.” 
“It[gay conversion therapy] was instrumental in helping me overcoming certain urges,” said the Vice President elect in an interview with Fox News. “With God’s help, and the work of many of his therapists, I was able to seek the straight path when I was a younger man. If it wasn’t for that, I would have never been able to marry.” 
Conversion therapy is psychological treatment or spiritual counseling designed to change a person’s sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. Such treatments are controversial and are a form of pseudoscience. However many orthodox and fundamentalist Christians believe that it does work, citing numerous examples of success. In more ancient times prior to 1981, conversion therapies in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies, chemical castration and various hormonal treatments. Efforts were largely concentrated on men, as female homosexuality was generally viewed as “hot.” This split along gender lines was due American’s general stupidity. 
Many of Mike Pence’s classmates at Indiana University said the young Pence struggled with “identity issues.” 
“Oh Mike was always a well-groomed sharp dresser,” said University of Chicago Professor James Badwater who was a dorm roommate of Mr. Pence in 1983. “He was private and kept to himself. He had a large collection of Men’s fitness magazines and listened to Wham! continually. He got into the conversion thing the next year, and then immediately married Karen [Mike Pence’s wife] the following year. It’s going to be great to have our first gay Vice President.” 
It’s unclear how this news will impact the Donald Trump administration, if at all, however many GOP insiders maintain that this demonstrates the incoming administration’s commitment to diversity and the “widening” of the party’s platform to be more inclusive of what have traditionally been party outsiders."
"title: Terrorists attack police training college in Pakistan: 60 cadets killed and 120 injured author: nan text: (7 fans) - Advertisement - At lease 60 cadets were killed and more than 116 injured as terrorists attack the Police Training College in Quetta, Pakistan, in one of the deadliest extremist attacks this year. Three gunmen burst into the sprawling academy, targeting sleeping quarters home to some 700 recruits, and sent terrified young men aged between 15 and 25 fleeing, Dawn News reported. Communication intercepts showed the attack was carried out by Al-Alimi faction of the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi militant group, IG Frontier Corps (FC) Major General Sher Afgan said. The group itself has not claimed the attack. Most of the deaths were caused when two of the attackers blew themselves up. The third was shot dead by Frontier Corps (FC) troops. At least 120 people were injured, according to Dawn News. The IG FC said ""terrorists were communicating with their handlers in Afghanistan"". ""There were three terrorists and all of them were wearing suicide vests,"" he added. The training college is situated on Sariab Road, which is considered to be one of the most sensitive areas of Quetta. Militants have been targeting security forces in the area for almost a decade. 
The attack comes a day after militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army on a motorcycle shot dead two coast guards and a civilian and wounded a shopkeeper in a remote southwest coastal town in Balochistan. 
In August, a suicide bombing at a Quetta hospital claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban killed 73 people, including many of the city's lawyer community who had gone there to mourn the fatal shooting of a colleague. - Advertisement - Pakistan says intelligence agencies of India and Afghanistan are fanning unrest in Balochistan by helping the rebels and sectarian militant outfits. According to Islamabad Policy Research Institute, the Indian consulate in Kandahar, a border town, provides a firm base to train, arm and dispatch militants across the border to undertake sabotage activities in Balochistan. Indian companies have been awarded contracts on various projects to link Kabul with Balochistan near Iranian border; and in the bargain it makes the job of the Indian intelligence agency RAW easier. Last month Indian government formally offered political asylum to secessionist Baloch leaders. The Zee News of India reported that the media is buzz with reports that Brahumdagh Bugti, grandson of Nawaz Akbar Khan Bugti, is set to get Indian citizenship. He is currently living in exile in Switzerland. 
Balochistan is a key region for China's ambitious $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure project linking its western province of Xinjiang to the Arabian Sea via Pakistan. 
Security problems have mired CPEC in the past with numerous separatist attacks, but China has said it is confident the Pakistani military is in control. 18 Indian soldiers killed in an army base attack - Advertisement - The Quetta terrorist attack came five weeks after a militants attack on an army base in the garrison town of Uri in the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir -- killing 18 soldiers. The attack on Sept 18, which took place near the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed region, was one of the deadliest on an army base in Kashmir since militant attacks began in 1989, according to CNN. Tension remains high between the neighbors following the Uri attack. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been under intense pressure from his own party and the Indian public to respond to the Uri army base attack. Mr Modi came to power pledging to toughen India's response to what he calls cross-border incursions from Pakistan. He vowed that the Uri raid ""will not go unpunished"". On September 29, India announced that it had carried out early morning ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist camps in Pakistani controlled Kashmir. However, Pakistan denied that a cross border strike had taken place, saying that Indian troops had fired small arms across the Line of Control, killing two soldiers and injuring nine. The notion of surgical strike linked to alleged terrorists' bases is an illusion being deliberately generated by India to create false effects,"" the Pakistani military said in a statement."
"title: Diez consejos para preparar tu casa de cara a la llegada de tu primer hijo author: Redacción text: Diez consejos para preparar tu casa de cara a la llegada de tu primer hijo NUESTROS EXPERTOS TE ASESORAN vivienda 
El momento ha llegado. Sólo quedan unos pocos meses para que nazca vuestro hijo y tenéis que adaptar vuestro hogar ahora que vais a ser uno más. Ofrecemos unos consejos para que vuestro piso sea el sitio idóneo para vosotros y vuestro primogénito. 
1. Habitación infantil no regida por patrones patriarcales y sexistas : En lugar de pintarla de azul o rosa, mezcla los dos colores y obtendrás un violeta marronáceo francamente desagradable aunque 100% inclusivo y no discriminador. Con los juguetes puedes probar a poner un Action Man con peluca y bikini haciendo la colada y una Dora La Exploradora sosteniendo una metralleta, así el niño aprenderá a no asociar a un género concreto las labores del hogar o la violencia. 
2. Disfraza al niño de lámpara : Ciertos caseros pueden ver en un bebé un foco de problemas con los vecinos: ruidos, malos olores, llantos a altas horas de la noche… Por eso, recomendamos que durante el día sientes al bebé en una mesa y le pongas una pantalla de lámpara sobre la cabeza. Así, ante la visita inesperada del dueño del piso, podrá parecer una parte más del mobiliario doméstico. 
3. Inclúyele en el contrato de alquiler : El bebé va a disfrutar de las comodidades de vuestro hogar como cualquier otro inquilino. Por eso, es lógico que contribuya a los gastos derivados de alquiler, luz y agua. Desde luego, mientras sea menor de edad no podrá pagar su parte correspondiente, pero piensa lo bien que os vendrá en un futuro la inyección económica que os proporcionará el pago de la deuda millonaria que vuestro hijo habrá adquirido con vosotros por contrato. 
4. Vestid siempre como personajes de fantasía : Ir siempre disfrazados del Pato Donald o Bob Esponja alimentará la imaginación y la creatividad del bebé. Se llevará una gran desilusión cuando descubra que en realidad sólo sois unos funcionarios de Correos a punto de cumplir los 40, pero al menos vivirá feliz sus primeros años creyendo que su familia es especial. 
5. Instala en su móvil la app de Idealista : Vivir con tu hijo es una experiencia inigualable, pero seamos sinceros, estabais mucho más tranquilos viviendo solos. Instalad la app de Idealista en el móvil que cuelga encima de su cuna, que el niño se sienta “invitado” a buscar cuanto antes su apartamento de soltero. 
6. Esconde el porno : Trata de buscarles un sitio seguro a todas esas cintas de porno ruso, las esposas, los electrodos y el resto de juguetes que tu pareja y tú empezasteis a usar para avivar la pasión sexual que había desaparecido entre vosotros. Los niños de hoy en día nacen muy espabilados y, si lo descubriese, podría venderlo todo en el Cash Converters a la primera de cambio. 
7. Roba columpios del parque y ponlos en el salón : Es importante que los niños jueguen y se diviertan, pero nada da más pereza que llevarles al parque una fría tarde de febrero. Teniendo los columpios en casa, podréis permitiros no sacar al niño a la calle durante meses. Recomendamos que desatornilléis el columpio y lo subáis a vuestro piso de noche y siempre con el rostro cubierto si no queréis tener que leeros los consejos de nuestro artículo “Cómo cuidar a tu hijo en Alcalá Meco”. 
8. Compra calimocho : Cuando menos te lo esperes, tu hijo habrá crecido e, irremediablemente, querrá hacer botellón con sus amigos. Mejor que sea en casa en lugar de en un callejón de mala muerte y mejor con un buen vino que con un cartón de 60 céntimos. Además, un lingotazo a las botellas de vino puede ayudaros a volver a conciliar el sueño cuando el bebé os despierte a las 4 de la mañana. 
9. Fabrícale un pijama con flecos de fregona : Ya que el niño va a pasar horas y horas arrastrándose por el suelo de la casa, al menos que limpie el suelo. 
10. Llena su habitación de peluches : Si, servirán para divertir y hacer compañía al niño, pero principalmente debes de usar los peluches para esconder dentro de ellos el dinero que ganaste en el Euromillón sin que lo supiera tu pareja para gastártelo tú."
"title: Interview 1230 – New World Next Week with James Evan Pilato author: Corbett text: 11/25/2016 at 3:22 am 
I’m all for a recount, because it could do exactly what James suggests, puts the whole thing in chaos (and this is exactly what I said here before the election). I was furious when Al Gore simply gave up in 2000 when he should have fought on to the bitter end, and if there really are “irregularities” which would put this election in question, the people need to know that, even if it doesn’t actually change anything. Chaos is a very revealing state, and anything that elevates awareness of the farce that is our “two faces of a single coin” political system is good. 
Of course if one believes the election was totally rigged start to finish, then no doubt they would believe that this is just another act in the play already written, so probably would downplay it entirely. So, ironically, the people who most believe the election was rigged are the ones who care least about that being explored. Because that exploration is just as false as the election, of course. That’s an unfortunate position, I think, and in this case may just go to serve the purposes of the criminal elite; that’s the trap in that sort of absolutist structuralist thinking. 
I say stir it up, even if in the end it only provides for interesting theater."
"title: She Drank a Gallon of Water/Day for a Month and Now She Looks 10 Years Younger author: noreply@blogger.com (Alexander Light) text: . She Drank a Gallon of Water/Day for a Month and Now She Looks 10 Years Younger Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/she-drank-gallon-of-waterday-for-month.html Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than one in five of us drinks enough. Read on to see the results of this experiment. Sarah Smith is a 42 year old mother of two young kids in the UK. She, like many others, openly admitted to not drinking the recommended 2 to 3 liters of water daily. She suffered from poor and sluggish indigestion and regular headaches. Following consultations with medical professionals for both issues she decided to take heed of the advice given – in both cases she had been told that she needed to up her intake of water . She decided to document and photograph what happened in a self imposed experiment whereby she would drink 3 liters, just over 5 pints, of water per day, every day for an entire month and see if she could feel any benefits.At the outset Sarah took a long hard look at her face noting that: “I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any lustre. It looks dead… even my lips look shrivelled.” She spread the water out during the day aiming to drink a big jug of water in the morning, another in the afternoon with a third in the evening.At the end of the FIRST WEEK she had already noticed that her bowel function was improved and her urine was virtually clear as the water was flushing out her previously dehydrated poorly functioning kidneys. She noticed sudden skin breakouts, which were a result of the toxins being eliminated from throughout her body. However, her headaches were already gone and her previous joint stiffness first thing in the morning was vastly improved. Water is vital for lubricating the joints. WEEK TWO saw an improvement in her skin tone and general complexion although she noted that her eyes were still wrinkled but said “they look less crepey and shadowy than before”. She also had a visibly flatter stomach and her smart husband paid her the ultimate compliment by noting that her cellulite had vanished! Significantly she had another week headache free.On to WEEK THREE when Sarah was happy to find that her eye wrinkles and dark circles had all but disappeared and her skin was plumper and healthier looking.She noted that she was actually eating less by this stage as she had fallen into the common trap of reading signals from her stomach as being hunger pangs whereas they were actually thirst pangs. Research has shown that 37 per cent of people actually mistake thirst signals for hunger signals. The plentiful water had now stopped her from continually falling into that unhealthy trap.So what about the end of WEEK FOUR ? Sarah said: “I genuinely can’t believe the difference in my face. I look like a different woman. The dark shadows around my eyes have all but disappeared and the blotches have gone. My skin is almost as dewy as it was when I was a child. The transformation is nothing short of remarkable.” She was leaner, fitter and nobody can deny the astonishing change to her appearance. She changed nothing else in her daily routine apart from the water intake. To those already of you already converted to drinking enough water these results will merely confirm what you already know, but to anyone who is guilty of not doing so, will this persuade you to try this for yourself? Alexander : Since we have addressed the miraculous rejuvenating power of water, here is one more mind-blowing fact. According to Gregg Prescott of In5D.com , he was able to restore his hair's original color after only six months of drinking distilled water . In his own words: ""In August of 2010, I was 2 months away from turning 50 and my hair was predominantly gray, with pronounced lines around my eyes. This is when I began to be conscientious about my eating habits and started eating more organic food, although I was still eating processed food as well. I began drinking distilled water in February 2012. By August of 2012, my hair had turned from gray back to its original color and the facial lines were not as pronounced."" And the results are fantastic! Here's a before and after comparison: You can buy a good quality water distiller from Amazon for about $200, which is not that much considering the benefits.

"title: Megyn [sic] Kelly BTFO by Newt: “You are Fascinated with Sex” author: Andrew Anglin text: The prophecy is coming true. 
Every cuck loser who enters Trump’s proximity turns into a mega-shitlord. 
Newt Gingrich just taught the slut Megyn [sic] Kelly how to shut her whore mouth. 
Wow. 
Washington Post : 
Gingrich, on Fox in his role as a Donald Trump surrogate, had questioned the stories of women whoâve come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault â and the relative importance of the controversy itself, relative to Hillary Clintonâs alleged misdeeds. 
Kelly pushed back. âAs a media story, we donât get to say that 10 women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir,â said the Fox anchor. 
âSure. Okay,â Gingrich said. â So, so itâs worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton had a secret speech in Brazil to a bank that pays her 225,000 [dollars], saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America â thatâs not worth covering âŚ â 
âThat is worth covering,â interjected Kelly. âAnd we did.â 
Gingrich was still speaking: â âŚ I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently, you are fascinated with sex, and you donât care about public policy. â 
âMe? Really?â she said, laughing. 
âWell, thatâs what I get out of watching you tonight,â Gingrich said. 
Cue crosstalk. 
KELLY: âYou know what, Mr. Speaker, Iâm not fascinated by sex. But I am fascinated by the protection of women âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and understanding what weâre getting in the Oval Office âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and I think the American voters would like to know âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âAnd, therefore, weâre going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all, you are worried about sexual predators.â 
âYeah, listen, itâs not about me,â Kelly said. âItâs about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations and, in large part, believe that they are a real issue. And donât dismiss the women âŚâ 
And: resume crosstalk. 
GINGRICH: âYou want to comment, you want to comment âŚâ 
KELLY: â âŚ donât dismiss the women summarily.â 
GINGRICH: â âŚ on whether the Clinton â do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator.â 
KELLY: âWe on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered that story as well, sir. I will tell you, the polls âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âNo, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words âBill Clinton, sexual predator.â I dare you. [At that point, Gingrich was smiling slightly. Kelly was not.] âSay âBill Clinton, sexual predator.ââ 
KELLY: âMr. Speaker, weâve covered â excuse me, sir âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Iowa, by the Arkansas bar.â 
KELLY: âExcuse me. excuse me.â 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Arkansas bar. Eight hundred fifty thousand dollar penalty.â 
KELLY: â âŚ excuse me, sir. We on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered the Clinton matter as well. Weâve hosted Kathleen Willey âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âWell, try saying it.â 
KELLY: â âŚ weâve covered the examples of him being accused as well, but heâs not on the ticket. And the polls also show that the American public is less interested âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âHeâll be in the, heâll be in the East Wing.â 
KELLY: â âŚ in the deeds of Hillary Clintonâs husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump. Weâre going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.â 
GINGRICH: âAnd you, too.â 
I haven’t seen a bitch get shut down like this since the 80s. I thought he was going to reach through the screen and start slapping her around, OLD SCHOOL. 
I hate this bitch so, so much. 
She alone is proof that women should never, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the kitchen or speak with men who are not their husbands, fathers or brothers. 
Because really, as funny as this exchange was, it isn’t really about sex. If it was about sex, as Newt mentions, she could easily focus on Bill, who is a literal rapist. 
It is about sexism. 
Anti-male sexism by a feminist whore. 
Megyn [sic] Kelly should be in prison."
"title: Trump And Putin: 'We Will Destroy ISIS Once And For All!' author: Arnold Monteverde (noreply@blogger.com) text: Over the past few months, relations between the United States and the Russian Federation have sunk to their lowest levels since the Cold War with bitter insults and threats being thrown around on both sides of the divide. However, the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States seems to have brought some change to this dangerous situation.


Trump and Putin vow to fight Islamic State together 

The president -elect and the Russian President Vladimir Putin have confirmed that they have had a healthy and productive conversation regarding relations between the countries and their shared purpose in tackling global terrorism. The telephone call was instigated by Putin who wanted to express his congratulations to Trump after he took the top job in American politics. During the conversation, Putin is reported to have said that he is ready to pick up a dialogue with officials from the United States “by mutual respect, non-intervention into each other’s internal affairs”.

The two men agreed during their brief telephone call that they would lay the groundwork to bring in a new era of Russia-American cooperation. According to a source, Putin and Trump have agreed to “work to channel bilateral relationships into constructive cooperation, to combine efforts to tackle international terrorism and extremism, and to continue contact by telephone and to work towards meeting in person” . 


Trump’s office continued with this optimism and placatory stance saying: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.""

In a follow-up statement, a Kremlin spokesperson said that the United States and Russia were planning to work together in both trade and economics as well as the threat posed by international terrorist organizations such as Islamic State. The fight against Islamic State may prove to be of essential importance in the coming months as top Islamic State commanders have already expressed their intention to exploit Donald Trump’s outspoken opinions on ordinary Muslims. Islamic commander Abu Omar Khorasani has said that Trump’s words have played directly into the hands of the terrorist organization. He said; ""This guy is a complete maniac. His utter hate towards Muslims will make our job much easier because we can recruit thousands.""

Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballotsafter a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. 
The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. 

An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 

ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. 

The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. 
Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: 

Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" 

The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" 

This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. 

Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?  "
"title: CONFIRMED: Washington Insider Responsible For Clinton “Hit Job” | Conservative Daily Post author: Matthew Bernstein text: 
Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 2, 2016 | American Strength Washington, Not Russia, Was Responsible! 
If you are been paying attention to what the Democrats are saying this election in terms of the hacks, they will tell you that it’s all part of a plot that involves Donald Trump and Russia. Every top Democrat from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama has argued that. 
They have been saying this ever since the first hacks on the Democratic National Committee happened back in July. And they have continued that claim with every hack that has happened since. Most recently they have been saying that the hacks on Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were part of yet another Russian hack. 
They have claimed that the hacks were done in order to influence the election in favor of Trump. Not everyone believes that lie. In fact there are people out there that think that the source of the hack has come from the United States government. 
One person that believes that is former British ambassador Craig Murray. He says that the source of the Podesta leaks was a Washington insider rather than someone from Russia. That would mean that Clinton’s campaign is continuing to make a false claim on a foreign country! 
Murray told Sputnik, “The source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all. I discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam’s whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow.” 
That means that there is someone in Washington that is doing what he or she can to end the corruption of the Clintons. And yet her camp continues to claim that someone within Russia did it. Because that is a phenomenal way to create peace between two nations that have nuclear weapons. Someone In Washington Is Trying To Make Sure Hillary Doesn’t Win 
But that wasn’t the only thing that Murray went on to destroy. He went on to blast the Democrats other narrative that WikiLeaks is a source for Russia. He has said that such claims are “designed to divert attention from the content of the material.” That means that they are hiding something if they are spending this much time trying to change the story. 
WikiLeaks also decided to mock the Clinton campaign’s literal obsession with conspiracy theories with a tweet. They said, “No link between Trump & Russia. No link between Assange & Russia. But Podesta & Clinton involved in selling 20% of US uranium to Russia.” 
This tweet was in reference to the fact that the FBI found nothing of substance that connected Donald Trump to Russia. They literally said that he had “no clear link to Russia.” So once again, the Democrats attempt to say something like that is proven false. 
That also means that if the Democrats continue to blame Trump for this supposed Russian hack on their servers, then they are definitely hiding something. Because the FBI has cleared Trump of any connection to Russia and now there is a former British ambassador that has said that the hacks were coming from someone located in Washington. 
And there are other claims to back that up. There was a YouTube video that was released and has gone viral. In it, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Steve Pieczenik is talking about how there are people in the United States government are doing what they can to prevent Clinton from becoming president of the United States. 
He has said that members of the United States government, including the FBI and the CIA, have “initiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange and WikiLeaks in order to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president of the United States.” Pieczenik has also said that Assange has released “emails that we gave to him in order to undermine Hillary and Bill Clinton.” 
That is two former high ranking members of their respective governments saying that the leak has come from Washington and not Russia like the Democrats want you to believe. But it goes even further than that. What Murray has said is true. They are doing whatever they can to have the people of the United States not look at those emails that were released. The Democrats Continue To Blame Russia For The Hacks. Because That Is A Great Foreign Policy Tactic 
That is because those emails have shown that the Democrats are engaging in some highly illegal activity. From all the leaks that we have seen, the Democrats have engaged in election rigging, pay-to-play operations, and cheating in several different debates. But of course when you try and confront them on this, they will attempt to say that Russia was behind it or that Trump was behind it. 
One of the excuses that they have also given has come from interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile. During the second hack of the DNC back in July she attempted to scare people from reading the hacked emails by saying that they could possibly be infected with malware . Really? If you are making this big an attempt to stop people from reading them, then you are obviously hiding something! 
Of course Brazile was mentioned in those WikiLeaks emails as well. She was guilty of giving Clinton a question that was going to appear in a town hall. And when someone called her out on it, Brazile attempted to say that she was being “ persecuted .” It’s not persecution if the answer is right in front of you! You were literally doing what you could to help out Clinton as much as possible. 
Share this article to show that there are people out there that believe that the hacks on the Democratic Party are coming from Washington itself rather than Russia. And considering that the Democrats continue to blame Russia for the hacks means that they are just damaging the foreign relationships even more. 
That is not something that the United States can afford anymore. We need people that are going to work on making our relationships with foreign governments better not worse. We also need people that are going to lead the people and not have to answer to more corruption charges. This is why we need Donald Trump. "
"title: What Was the Halloween Death Smog Disaster? And Other Scary Questions and Answers About Fluoridation author: nan text: License DMCA 
1. Why do some people object to water fluoridation? Doesn't fluoride occur in the water naturally anyway? 
The fluoride products used in water fluoridation (sodium fluoride or fluorosilicic acid) are classified as hazardous waste products of the fertilizer, aluminum, and nuclear industries. They are even more toxic than naturally-occurring fluoride, since they contain other components, such as arsenic and lead. 
However, even naturally-occurring fluoride, in areas with high concentrations (over 1 ppm) have been found to have extremely adverse health effects. Even before additional fluoride is added, the level of natural fluoride in the water in many areas in the U.S. is already equal to the amount of naturally-occurring fluoride that has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis in other countries. Studies done in India and China found skeletal fluorosis in areas containing naturally occurring fluoride as low as .07 ppm. (Gupta R, Kumar AN, Bandhu S, Gupta S. (2007) Skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis. Scandanavian Journal of Rheumatology 36(2):154-5.) That same amount, .07 pmm is the current amount recommended by the CDC to be added to community water supplies. 
In addition to the natural fluoride in groundwater, most people are exposed to multiple sources of fluoride (pesticides in wine and food, tea, some ceramics, anti-depressants, pollution from manufacturing, soft drinks, Teflon pans, toothpaste etc.). They presumably are being exposed to well over the equivalent of 1 ppm before any fluoride is added to the water, however no industry or government testing has ever been done to find out how much fluoride the public is absorbing from all sources. This massive exposure to fluoride did not exist in the 1950's, when fluoride was first introduced. 
2. Don't all advanced countries fluoridate their water? And hasn't it been proven that countries that do fluoridate their water have better dental health than countries that don't? 
No. Fluoridation has been almost completely abolished in Europe. Recently other countries, such as Israel and many parts of Australia, have discontinued fluoridation. Statistics gathered by the World Health Organization do not show any difference in rates of dental caries in fluoridated vs. non fluoridated countries. (WHO Collaborating Center for Education, Training, and Research in Oral Health, Malmo Univ., Sweden, 2012.) Where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities like Canada, the former East Germany, Cuba and Finland, dental decay has not increased but rather has continued to decrease (Maupome' 2001; Kunzel & Fischer, 1997, 2000; Kunzel 2000; Seppa 2000). 
In the U.S., the state of Kentucky, which has been fluoridating the longest, and has achieved almost complete fluoridation of its water supply, has the worst dental health of any state in the country. From an article appearing in the Lexington Herald Leader (10/14/2009): ""Governor Beshear said Kentucky led the nation in 2004 in terms of the number of people age 65 or older who had lost teeth. About 27 percent of Kentuckians of all ages had lost six or more teeth to decay or gum disease, compared with 18 percent in the rest of the nation."" And yet, in 2004, 99.6% of Kentucky's public water systems were providing fluoridated water to their customers. This ranked Kentucky first among all states."" (Kentucky Epidemiologic Notes and Reports, Vol. 40. No. 8, Dept. of Public Health.) - Advertisement - 
Similar results were reported in Texas: ""After 9 years and $3 million of adding fluoride, research shows tooth decay hasn't dropped among the poorest of Bexar County's children, it has only increased--up 13 percent this year."" (Conger J., 2011, San Antonio: Added to our drinking water: a chemical 'more toxic than lead? ' KENS 5 News.) 
For the best article analyzing the research on fluoridation worldwide, see the article by John Colquhoun, DDS, Phd (former Chief Dental Officer of Auckland, NZ): Why I changed my mind about water fluoridation (Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 41 29-44 1997, University of Chicago Press). Colquhoun studied the effects of fluoridation around the world, with the intention of proving how beneficial it was, but discovered, to his astonishment, that people in countries using fluoridation had the worst teeth. He then began crusading to put an end to the practice. 
Since 1990, 144 cities have rejected water fluoridation. 
3. Where did the idea of fluoridating the water come from? 
Industrialists in the aluminum and nuclear industries were under fire because of the harmful effects of the fluoride waste products being emitted from their plants--animals and people were being sickened for miles around. They hired Edward Bernays, who was the inventor of mass public relations campaigns (Bernays also happened to be the nephew of Sigmund Freud) to convince the American people that putting toxic waste in our water supply was good for us. - Advertisement - 
Bernays had organized a successful campaign, on behalf of Lucky Strike cigarettes, to convince American women that smoking was both glamorous and liberating. He hired models to pose as debutantes in a march for women's rights. When Bernays gave the signal, all the women lit up their cigarettes. Another successful propaganda campaign that he orchestrated was the overthrow of a democratically-elected government in Guatemala on behalf of the United Fruit Company. The Nazis studied and made use of Bernays' techniques for their propaganda programs. (A more in-depth discussion of Bernays' role in the campaign to convince the public to accept fluoridation can be found in the video ""The Fluoride Deception"" at youtube.com, and the book with the same name by Christopher Bryson, Seven Stories Press). 
4. OK, so maybe fluoridation hasn't been proven to be effective in improving dental health, but what harm can it do to add it to our water supply? 
First there is the cost factor. At a time when there is no money for schools, dental treatment for kids, support for the homeless and basic community services, counties are spending millions of dollars to fluoridate the water. Even worse, fluoridation has been associated with increased rates of kidney disease, Alzheimer's, bone cancer, damage to the thyroid, increased bone fractures, hyperactivity, and decreased IQ in children. (See http://www.robertgammal.com/PDFs/SciFactsFluoride.pdf .) 
Although adding hazardous waste to our water is not beneficial to anyone, it is particularly harmful to people with kidney disease (who can't excrete it properly), infants (when mixed with formula it far exceeds the safe amount of fluoride), farmworkers (already exposed to fluoride in pesticides), tea drinkers, people taking anti-depressants, people with low thyroid, and those who have chemical sensitivities. Also adversely affected would be people who drink lots of water such as diabetics, athletes, and manual laborers."
"title: Minsk meeting being held to determine status of Donetsk and Lugansk, don't expect much - Russia News Now author: nan text: This post was originally published on this site 
sott.net/news 
A meeting of the contact group on the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis is going to be held today in Minsk. 
Steinmeier’s formula 
The primary issue of this meeting is going to be the consideration of Steinmeier’s formula, which determines a special status for Donetsk and Lugansk and, after the publication of the election results in these regions, potential transfer to self-government. Moreover, the officials of these republics say that, without agreement on this matter, it is impossible to solve any other problems. 
Meanwhile, Kiev is delaying decision-making on this issue. The talks are going very slowly and unproductively. 
Provocations 
In addition, Kiev is continuing provocations against Russia. Despite the fact that Russia is not a party to the conflict and does not participate in these talks, Kiev’s provocations negatively affect the credibility of Ukraine and do not help the course of the group’s work. 
Just recently, Kiev sent several groups of spies and saboteurs to Russia and kidnapped two Russian citizens. Now they are being detained with the possibility of ransom, which suggests that all of this was started for the sole purpose of at least slightly improving Ukraine’s deplorable financial condition. 
The neutral territory 
During his visit to Moscow yesterday, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said that Belarus was a neutral party and would not support any of the conflict’s sides, despite the fact that Kiev has really done everything possible to foment bad relations with all of its neighbors, including even its traditional anti-Russian ally – Poland. 
The incident with the Belarusian aircraft, when Ukraine threatened to raise fighters against a passenger liner flying from Kiev to Minsk, did nothing good for the international image of Poroshenko, nor for Ukrainian-Belarusian relations, which until recently were considered to be even closer than relations between Minsk and Moscow. 
Expectations 
All of these facts suggest that no high expectations should be held for the meeting. Most likely, Kiev will once again delay the solution of fundamental problems, confining itself to blackmail over prisoners of the DPR and the LPR. Perhaps some contract clauses will be agreed upon, but no more should be expected. Related "
"title: Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Maced, Hit with Rubber Bullets in Standoff Over Ancestral Land author: nan text: Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Maced, Hit with Rubber Bullets in Standoff Over Ancestral Land Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Emma Niles 
Tensions flared again Wednesday between North Dakota law enforcement and protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline. Filmmaker and activist Josh Fox was at the scene of the violent confrontation, where journalist Erin Schrode, among others, was shot with a rubber bullet at the front lines of the protest. 
“This is an insane situation,” Fox begins in a video streamed live to his Facebook page after the confrontation. “We had a line of peaceful water protectors in the water, up to their waists, who were freezing cold. Those people were standing in front of a line of police, the police were occupying treaty land—not their land. Police were there with riot gear on, with shotguns, with rubber bullets, with mace, with pepper spray.” 
According to NBC , Wednesday’s conflict took place at Cantapeta Creek, which runs just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. Protesters grew agitated when police “dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site.” The “sacred site” refers to the hilltop across the creek where Standing Rock Sioux tribal ancestors are buried. 
The Young Turks network shared a brief video highlighting the escalating tensions: 
“This is land that is theirs, per the Laramie Treaty of 1851 ,” Schrode says in the video above. “This is a militarized police force up against an unarmed, peaceful, prayerful people.” 
  
Women and children were reportedly present at the demonstrations. 
Another video, streamed live on Facebook by user Cempoalli Twenny, provides a clear shot of the bridge in question. Drumbeats and chants can be heard as several “water protectors” attempt to cross the river: 

In a separate video , Twenny says that while being interviewed, police “shot at the reporter” but were “possibly aiming for me.” 
“[A] sista reporter was hit [instead],” he writes, referring to Schrode. 
On Facebook, Schrode shared video of the incident, which shows her interviewing Twenny when suddenly she is hit: 

“I was just shot,” says Schrode, a journalist who has worked with CNN, NBC and The New York Times, in a Wednesday post . “Militarized police fired at me from point blank range with a rubber bullet on the front lines of Standing Rock.” 
She continues: 
My body will be okay, but I am hurting, I am incensed, I am weeping, I am scared. Peaceful, prayerful, unarmed, nonviolent people on one side of a river; militarized police with armed vehicles and assault weapons occupying treaty land on the other, where sacred burial grounds have already been destroyed. What is happening here in North Dakota is like nothing I have ever seen in my life, anywhere in the world. … 
It is inexcusable for the President Obama to say he will “let it play out for several more weeks.” It is unjustifiable for the Attorney General to not be here. It is unconscionable for mainstream media to not cover this. It is indefensible for all politicians to not condemn what is occurring here. It is disgraceful for more people to not speak out and show up to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney provided a very different perspective on the conflict. “In my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law, or other people’s rights because of someone else’s ideology,” he states in a press release. “The idea that because you have a strong opinion about something means you can threaten, harass and intimidate other American citizens is just plain wrong.” 
Numerous video accounts show police officers firing rubber bullets at those standing in the water. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department released a statement regarding its tactics. 
“Law enforcement witnessed protesters building an illegal, man-made, wooden bridge across the Cantapeta Creek,” the statement reads. “Protesters involved in building the bridge violated numerous federal and state laws including the Clean Water Act and the Safe River and Harbors Act.” 
The statement continues: 
Authorities used less-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation. In one incident a male was at a boat and was throwing bottles at officers on the police line. A second incident occurred when a man wearing a gas mask, refused to show his hands, refused to disperse and charged the police line. Officers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers. No lethal shots were fired from law enforcement. 
According to the press release, one person was arrested for “conspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function” after purchasing kayaks and canoes for the demonstrators. In the past few months, hundreds of people have been arrested while fighting to halt the DAPL. 
“It was like witnessing Gandhi’s Salt March,” Fox says, “then suddenly I am watching people being maced, and I hear a pop and see that they shot Erin Schrode with a rubber bullet. How is it possible that from 10 feet away, they are shooting at   journalists, bystanders, medics?” TAGS:"
"title: I Lived in a 38-Person Co-Op in San Francisco, and so Can You author: nan text: I Lived in a 38-Person Co-Op in San Francisco, and so Can You The joy and practice of learning to share By Tommy Alexander / thebolditalic.com Community living is blossoming in 21st-century San Francisco. This trend exists at the confluence of diverse historical narratives: the free-love and experimental ethos of the hippie movement, the casual opulence of the city’s Victorian-era homes and the earnest audacity of start-up culture. These are co-ops where programmers and cooks rub shoulders with artists and teachers, where the phrase “love and gratitude” is used as a casual valediction, and where globally minded innovators are working to develop replicable models for urban shared living. I live in a 13-person co-op in a big old house near the apex of Ashbury Street. Up here in the fog between the hills and the sky, we are sharing a fundamental human experience: a sense of belonging and collaborative meaning-making that can be difficult to find in modern urban society. These choices may seem unconventional, but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful, creative and affordable existence amid the hectic, electric bustle of our context. My housemates and I share food, resources and vision. We cook together; we clean together; and we meet regularly to discuss our mutual stake in this community. Some of us work nine-to-five office jobs; some of us work on nights and weekends; and others work primarily from home — so we use Slack, the messaging app, to stay on the same page. We keep records of logistical information on a Google Drive, and we manage our common-pool funds in a shared bank account. We make group decisions using a combination of consensus and do-ocracy . There are jams and sharing circles as well as neighborhood-focused events, potlucks, talks and the occasional party — and we must communicate thoughtfully with each other to make sure that everyone’s needs are met. These choices may seem unconventional, but they have enabled us to forge a meaningful, creative and affordable existence amid the hectic, electric bustle of our context. I’m aware that the concept of communal living carries cultural baggage. When I speak to friends and family who haven’t experienced anything quite like this, they invariably draw comparisons to communes and college dorms. Those are communities, too, but the vast spectrum of human collectivism is far more multifaceted than these few common examples might imply. It is natural to process new phenomena in terms of what we know, but it is also important to understand that each community is a unique collection of individuals. I’ve met a great many bright, passionate and reasonable people who have elected to pool resources with each other, and it looks a little bit different each time. There is no singular “type” of person that benefits most from shared living. Each day, I awoke with a visceral sense of belonging. As for me, I arrived in San Francisco in June of 2015. I had just landed my first full-time writing job out of college. I grew up in hot, flat San Jose in the sprawling, suburban shadow of “the city,” and some yearning part of me had always identified more with the foggy peninsula than the sunny valley. I was coming here alone, and I knew that I wanted to move in with a group of people. I answered a Craigslist ad, filled out an online application and underwent a series of casual phone interviews — and there I was on the doorstep of a 24-person co-op that spanned the lower two floors of a four-story walk-up on the north side of Alamo Square. For the first few weeks, I felt that my social capacity was being worn down to a nub: there were so many new faces; there was so much happening all the time; and I was always a step behind. The people were warm and welcoming, however, and their home became my home. Within the month, the lease was up, and the community disbanded due to a difference in vision between the two cofounders. The members were variously scattered across the city and the East Bay. I joined a wave of 38 people who were moving into a 10-bedroom, four-story Victorian mansion around the block. The founders called it Chateau Ubuntu, for the Bantu word that roughly translates to “I am human because you are human.” On July 1, I found myself sleeping in a bunk bed in a large third-floor master bedroom with five other people, four chandeliers and a fireplace topped by a marble relief of three nude nymphs. I lived in that room for nine months — a gestation — and my experience became a fascinating journey through the building blocks of humanity. I discovered that community is a synecdoche for society, and that any human system is just a web of agreements. I learned what it takes to keep a co-living unit afloat amid the various logistical necessities of city living: the rent, the utilities, the food, the facilities and how to facilitate the needs and wants of 38 unique individuals. I radically challenged my preconceptions about sharing space, time and resources. I fell deeply in love, and I found confidence in my art. Each day, I awoke with a visceral sense of belonging. To the uninitiated, a 38-person community living so densely in a single home often comes across as mad. In the act, however, it felt as though nothing could be more natural. There were deep and frustrating downsides, of course: high membership turnover, too little privacy and some unresolved interpersonal tensions. We were rarely able to wrangle a meaningful consensus, with so many people constantly in and out. Yet the physical closeness, coupled with a culture of radical acceptance, fostered perhaps the most warm and loving community of humans that I have ever experienced. For every serious meeting or disagreement, there was a “cuddle puddle,” a “gratitude circle,” an impromptu jam session or a big shared meal. Eventually, I burned out on the sheer density of Chateau Ubuntu. I needed a smaller and less socially absorptive environment in which to create more intention around my work, my art, my life and my love. I needed space to think. Along with a few friends, my partner and I left Chateau Ubuntu to cofound a new, smaller community: our current home, Chaortica . We remain connected to a colorful coalition of other communities in the greater Haight-Ashbury area and beyond, including Ubuntu and the flagship house of the Embassy Network. We’ve tapped into the Fellowship for Intentional Community , a global directory of shared-living communities that includes communes, eco-villages, co-ops and collectives of all stripes. We don’t have it all figured out, but we are working together and collaborating on our dreams. Indeed, we cannot ever expect this to be perfect. As with any team, relationship or government, an intentional community is a constant practice, not a steady state. Certainly, some of the communities that take root in San Francisco are more ephemeral than others. There are ventures that fold within a year, and there are cooperatives that raise children in their midst. I’ve not encountered a house here that did not experience at least some small occasional turnover, but this does not mean that we are building sand castles. There is such a vast, wild richness to the spectrum of human experience, and each person whom I’ve met has taught me something about myself. When we come together across disparate backgrounds, we inform and expand each other’s humanity. I posit that community living can be just as empowering as living alone but that it is always an exercise in adaptation. It works only with empathy, humility and a mutually assured foundation of healthy, open communication. One might argue that these practices are essential to the future of our species on a crowding , warming planet of 7.4 billion people . Cities are denser and pricier than ever, and we must learn to share — on a personal and civilizational scale — in ways that we have scarcely imagined. I do not mean that we all need to live in co-ops and communes, but I do contend that it is worthwhile for each of us to reconsider how much we can trust one another. I hope that we can all take the principle of collectivism as a nugget in and of itself rather than a subordinate component of gentrification, for collaboration is not a limitation. The solution to density is trust, not fear. Sharing is easier when we parse our wants from our needs. Life is more meaningful together.

"title: FBI Visits Man at His Home After He Films US Postal Distribution Center author: Ryan Banister text: 
A copblocker in southern California was visited by two FBI agents at his home after conducting a first amendment audit at a US Postal Central Distribution Center, where he filmed inside and outside of the building as an effort to verify that the right to film was respected in that location.

Felipe Hernandez and fellow auditors began to film one of the controlled entry points at the facility, and almost immediately two US Postal Service Police park their cruisers in front of them, one blockading the sidewalk. They asked questions and paced back and forth, but they eventually left without incident.
After a few minutes, Hernandez walked to another gate to film only to find another individual in an unmarked car following surveilling their activities. However, no further police contact was made and the auditors left.
Nearly two weeks later on October 19, Hernandez filmed two plain clothes agents from the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, one with a clipboard, asking him questions pertaining to his filming of a US mail distribution facility. The agent declares that filming “critical infrastructure” can be considered “suspicious activity,” and that is why he is investigating Hernandez.

Hernandez tells them that he was instructed by his lawyer, who was on the phone at that moment, to not answer any questions. After a few minutes, Hernandez hands one of the agents the cell phone and they speak directly with his lawyer.
The agent tells the attorney that the filming of a US

"title: What to Do About ‘Fake News’ author: nan text: What to Do About ‘Fake News’ November 18, 2016 
Exclusive: A pushback is coming to the Internet’s success in giving the world access to diverse opinions and dissenting information. Politicians, mainstream media and technology giants are taking aim at what they call “fake news,” reports Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
In the wake of Donald Trump’s victory, a hot new issue – raised by President Obama in an international setting on Thursday and touted on The New York Times’ front page on Friday – is the problem of “fake news” being disseminated on the Internet. 
Major Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, are being urged to censor such articles and to punish alleged violators. Also, teams of supposedly “responsible” news providers and technology giants are being assembled to police this alleged problem and decide what is true and what is not. President Obama in the Oval Office. 
But therein lies the more serious problem: who gets to decide what is real and what is not real? And – in an age when all sides propagate propaganda – when does conformity in support of a mainstream “truth” become censorship of reasonable skepticism? 
As a journalist for more than four decades, I take seriously the profession’s responsibility to verify information as much as possible before publishing it – and as editor of Consortiumnews.com, I insist that our writers (and to the extent possible, outside commenters) back up what they say. 
I personally hate “conspiracy theories” in which people speculate about a topic without real evidence and often in defiance of actual evidence. I believe in traditional journalistic standards of cross-checking data and applying common sense. 
So, I am surely no fan of Internet hoaxes and baseless accusations. Yet, I also recognize that mainstream U.S. news outlets have made horrendous and wholesale factual errors, too, such as reporting in 2002-03 that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program (The New York Times) and was hiding stockpiles of WMD (many TV and print outlets, including The Washington Post). 
And, mainstream outlets getting such life-and-death stories wrong was not just a one-off affair around the Iraq invasion. At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light. 
For instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal , but actively covered up the Reagan administration’s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s. 
The Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times’ gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration.

In that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan’s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons. 
More recently, during the mad dash to invade Iraq in 2002-03, the Post’s editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt wrote repeatedly as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and mocked the few dissenting voices that challenged the “group think.” 
Yet, Hiatt suffered no accountability for his falsehoods and is still the Post’s editorial-page editor, still peddling dubious examples of Washington’s conventional wisdom . 
Ministry of Truth 
So, who are the “responsible” journalists who should be anointed to regulate what the world’s public gets to see and hear? For that Orwellian task, a kind of Ministry of Truth has been set up by Google, called the First Draft Coalition , which touts itself as a collection of 30 major news and technology companies , including the Times and Post, tackling “fake news” and creating a platform to decide which stories are questionable and which ones aren’t. Correspondent Michael Usher of Australia’s “60 Minutes” claims to have found the billboard visible in a video of a BUK missile launcher after the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014, but the scenes actually don’t match up at all. (Screen shot from Australia’s “60 Minutes”) 
Formed in June 2015 and funded by Google News Lab, the First Draft Coalition’s founding members included Bellingcat, an online “citizen journalism” site that has gotten many of its highest profile stories wrong and is now associated with NATO’s favorite think tank, the Atlantic Council. 
Despite Bellingcat’s checkered record and its conflicts of interest through the Atlantic Council, major Western news outlets, including the Times and Post, have embraced Bellingcat, apparently because its articles always seem to mesh neatly with U.S. and European propaganda on Syria and Ukraine. 
Two of Bellingcat’s (or its founder Eliot Higgins’s) biggest errors were misplacing the firing location of the suspected Syrian rocket carrying sarin gas on Aug. 21, 2013, and directing an Australian news crew to the wrong site for the so-called getaway Buk video after the July 17, 2014 shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. A screen shot of the roadway where the suspected BUK missile battery supposedly passed after the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014. (Image from Australian “60 Minutes” program) 
But like many news outlets that support establishment “group thinks,” Bellingcat wins widespread praise and official endorsements, such as from the international MH-17 investigation that was largely controlled by Ukraine’s unsavory intelligence agency, the SBU and that accepted Bellingcat’s dubious MH-17 evidence blaming the Russians . 
If such a Ministry of Truth had existed in the mid-1980s, it might well have denounced the investigative reporting on the Contra-cocaine scandal since that was initially deemed untrue. And if “Minitrue” were around in 2002-03, it almost surely would have decried the handful of people who were warning against the “group think” on Iraq’s WMD. 
Power and Reality 
While it’s undeniable that some false or dubious stories get pushed during the heat of a political campaign and in wartime – and journalists have a role in fact-checking as best they can – there is potentially a greater danger when media insiders arrogate to themselves the power to dismiss contrary evidence as unacceptable, especially given their own history of publishing stories that turned out to be dubious if not entirely false. 
It’s even more dangerous when these self-appointed arbiters of truth combine forces with powerful Internet search engines and social media companies to essentially silence dissenting opinions and contrary facts by making them very difficult for the public to locate. 
Arguably even worse is when politicians – whether President-elect Donald Trump or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or President Obama – get into the business of judging what is true and what is false. 
On Thursday, an impassioned President Obama voiced his annoyance with “fake news” twice in his joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel — “because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television. … If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.” 
Let that phrase sink in for a moment: “We won’t know what to protect”? Is President Obama suggesting that it is the U.S. government’s role to “protect” certain information and, by implication, leave contrary information “unprotected,” i.e. open to censorship? 
On Friday, a New York Times front-page article took Facebook to task, in particular, writing: “for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news.” 
The Times added, in a complimentary way, “Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late.” 
Info-War 
This new alarm about “fake news” comes amid the U.S. government’s “information war” against Russia regarding the Syrian and Ukraine conflicts. Obama’s State Department insists that it is presenting the truth about these conflicts while Russia’s RT channel is a fount of disinformation. Yet, the State Department’s propaganda officials have frequently made false or unsupported claims themselves. Ukraine’s (now-former) Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk 
On Wednesday, there was the unseemly scene of State Department spokesman John Kirby refusing to answer reasonable questions from a Russian journalist affiliated with RT. 
The RT journalist asked Kirby to identify the hospitals and clinics in Syria that he was claiming had been hit by Russian and Syrian airstrikes. You might assume that a truth-teller would have welcomed the opportunity to provide more details that could then be checked and verified. 
But instead Kirby berated the RT journalist and tried to turn the rest of the State Department press corps against her. 
QUESTION: Don’t you think it is important to give a specific list of hospitals that you’re accusing Russia of hitting? Those are grave accusations. 
KIRBY: I’m not making those accusations. I’m telling you we’ve seen reports from credible aid organizations that five hospitals and a clinic — 
QUESTION: Which hospital — 
KIRBY: At least one clinic — 
QUESTION: In what cities at least? 
KIRBY: You can go look at the information that many of the Syrian relief agencies are putting out there publicly. We’re getting our information from them too. These reports — 
QUESTION: But you are citing those reports without giving any specifics. 
KIRBY: Because we believe these agencies are credible and because we have other sources of information that back up what we’re seeing from some of these reports. And you know what? Why don’t [you] ask … Here’s a good question. Why don’t you ask your defense ministry … what they’re doing and see if you can get…” 
QUESTION: If you give a specific list — 
KIRBY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
QUESTION: If you give a specific list of hospitals — 
KIRBY: No, no, no. 
QUESTION: My colleagues who are listening hopefully would be able to go and ask Russian officials about a specific list of hospitals that you’re accusing Russia of …” 
KIRBY: You work for Russia Today, right? Isn’t that your agency? 
QUESTION: That is correct. Yes. 
KIRBY: And so why shouldn’t you ask your government the same kinds of questions that you’re standing here asking me? Ask them about their military activities. Get them to tell you what they’re – or to deny what they’re doing. 
QUESTION: When I ask for specifics, it seems your response is why are you here? Well, you are leveling that accusation. 
KIRBY: No, ma’am. 
QUESTION: And if you give specifics, my colleagues would be able to ask 
Russian officials. 
As Kirby continued to berate the RT journalist and stonewall her request for specifics, an American reporter intervened and objected to Kirby’s use of the phrase “‘your defense minister’ and things like that. I mean, she’s a journalist just like the rest of are, so it’s – she’s asking pointed questions, but they’re not …” 
Kirby then insisted that since RT was “a state-owned” outlet that its journalists should not be put “on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.” (But the reality is that Voice of America, BBC and many other Western outlets are financed by governments or have ideological benefactors.) 
Public Diplomacy 
Kirby’s hostility toward legitimate questions being raised about U.S. or U.S.-allied assertions has become typical of Obama’s State Department, which doesn’t seem to want any challenges to its presentation of reality. A screen shot of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland speaking to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013, at an event sponsored by Chevron, with its logo to Nuland’s left. 
For instance, during the early phase of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry called RT a “propaganda bullhorn” and Richard Stengel, Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, issued a “DipNote” saying RT should be ostracized as a source of disinformation. 
But Stengel’s complaint revealed a stunning ignorance about the circumstances surrounding the February 2014 putsch that overthrew Ukraine’s elected President Viktor Yanukovych. 
For instance, Stengel cited RT’s “ludicrous assertion” about the U.S. investing $5 billion to promote “regime change” in Ukraine. Stengel apparently wasn’t aware that Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland had cited the $5 billion figure in support of Ukraine’s “European aspirations” during a public speech to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013. 
At the time, Nuland was a leading proponent of “regime change” in Ukraine, personally cheering on the Maidan demonstrators and even passing out cookies. In an intercepted, obscenity-laced phone call with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland said her choice to lead Ukraine was Arseniy “Yats is the guy” Yatsenyuk, who ended up as Prime Minister after the coup. 
So, was Stengel a purveyor of “fake news” when he was accusing RT of disseminating fake news or was he just assembling some propaganda points for his underlings to repeat to a gullible Western news media. Or was he just ill-informed? 
Both democracy and journalism can be messy businesses – and credibility is something that must be earned over time by building a reputation for reliability. There is no “gold seal” from the Establishment that makes you trustworthy. 
It’s simply important to do one’s best to inform the American people and the world’s public as accurately as possible. Awarding trust is best left to individual readers who must be the ultimate judges of what’s real and what’s fake.

Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer discussed the latest GAI report about the Obama Justice Department’s funneling of money to left-wing groups using fines levied against financial institutions. 
Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described the report as exposing the Justice Department of “quite literally extorting companies to fund left-wing activists.”

The reason that American police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty Harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing. It is American culture at the root, deep in the psyche. 
The police have been militarized. They dont do the job like in the old days. No more negotiators, Drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis, its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun, knife, glow stick, sandwich, whatever. Gary Honeycutt 
How old are you? The old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the 60’s, after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding “accomplishment”: a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims. Note the escalation of crime since then. It seems you are also on the anti-cop bandwagon. I support them being able to defend themselves. Mistakes can be made in a split second, the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop. I’m sure you can name victims of cops, do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute? Unfortunately, the justified shootings like the Ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions. First and foremost: don’t commit crime. That improves your odds drastically. Next, comply with orders given by the police. If you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you. Guilty or innocent, comply! The police are just trying to do their job, don’t complicate it. I’ve seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car. Try walking a mile in their shoes. They are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves. fluffnik 
“Guilty or innocent, comply!” 
Land of the free? 
Most places are successfully policed by consent, and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime. Gary Honeycutt 
Yes, if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason. If he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason. He is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area. Imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for 40 minutes before complying. If you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and you’ll be gone without any violence or hard feelings. If you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth. Of course, if you’ve seen the news and the reality shows You may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government. Mike 
Wasn’t raised hostile to cops, family members are cops as a matter of fact. This is America. If I’m not committing a crime, or suspected of it, don’t ask me for papers. Don’t detain me. Don’t run DUI checkpoints. Those are infringements on all of our freedom, which I assume we love. Safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior. Safety is a fallacy. dufas_duck 
I have had 5 police officers in my extended family. It got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the family’s homes. They were eventually never invited to family get to gathers. They were rude, overbearing, malicious individuals, constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be. Their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject, some familly member was wrong. Petty things like they didn’t like the car they bought, or their haircut, or the job they worked at…. They were not satisfied with anything or anybody… 
They brought their street attitude home with them. They couldn’t keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long. They were arrogant, mean, and only thaought of themselves..anybody else was in their way…. 
I have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds….. Gary Honeycutt 
My great-grandfather, his son-in-law (my grandfather)and his son, my uncle were all cops, the oldest and youngest for their whole careers. All deeply religious, highly moral men. dufas_duck 
That is great, if they were straight arrow, we need more like them. My cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the Crips, the Bloods, or just about any outlaw motorcycle club. No one but other cops were ‘proud’ of them. My family sure wasn’t proud of them… Gary Honeycutt 
Maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily? East side of Detroit? South side of Chicago? People are products of their environment. Maybe the cops in Branson, Mo. and such places are nice guys. What is the ratio of cops to citizens? Let’s say you’ve got a playground with 60 10 year olds. You get a dozen 10 year olds to keep order among them. If the 60 are from Sierra Leone and the dozen are American boy scouts there’d be 12 dead Americans in short order. Any dead among the 60 would’ve been killed by their own. So what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet, graduated from school and passed the academy. You think 10 years of patrolling the gnetto might change them? They surely know the realities of the job better than we do. How do the ones who aren’t in Mayberry do a 20 or 30 year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy? dufas_duck 
I do know that where I grew up, the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened. They rotated officers to different districts every month. But then, they found thst the police were trading assignments. Some cops didn’t want to rotate out. They wanted to stay where they were… No explaination was given by any officer,[at least publically, no answer was given..] 
Many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst… dufas_duck 
You just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members…. Gary Honeycutt 
I don’t think so, but you don’t throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a S.E.A.L. team to lifeguard the kiddie pool. dufas_duck 
“……. send a S.E.A.L. team to lifeguard the kiddie pool.” 
You haven’t checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then…? A 5 year old in handcuffs or throwing an 8 year old to the ground doesn’t work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace…… Anthony Fredericks 
I will end this stupidity of your right now GARY. I work with Police EVERY single day as a EMT. EVERY DAY! I am a qualified expert on how Police act on scene…Most of them are VERY arrogant, Rude and aggressive towards people. SHUT UP!! or BE QUIET!! is the first thing you normally hear from a cop, You ALWAYS see them put someone on the ground. Even if that person is the one who called them for help. If they don’t like you..BOOM! face down, knee on your neck, cuffs on. Approximately 25% are not like this. But the other 75% are. THIS IS REALITY GARY! And I have worked in SEVERAL cities in different areas…And it is all the same. Police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general public…And a lot of them take it out physically on them. Gary Honeycutt 
My sympathies for the flaw in your family’s DNA. dufas_duck 
Luckily, the flaw was only in the extended family tree…inlaws, marriages, etc…… ;-> Gary Honeycutt 
Most people who oppose DUI checkpoints have a reason. I’ve always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive. I don’t mind providing my ID when a cop asks for it. When it’s done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident. He’s just trying to do the job we are paying for. If you want to launch into a 40 minute tirade about your rights you’ll be there 40 minutes longer, make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up, maybe you like that. Some people love drama. Mike 
The reason is, it’s an infringement on your rights, and unnecessarily exposes you AND the Officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation. There is no way you believe that *unwanted* contact that is forced upon Officers and the public increases their safety. I wouldn’t blame the Officers for the policies they have to enforce, however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact. The problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong, you don’t see the infringement of your rights, and tolerate them. Just because you aren’t guilty of anything, doesn’t mean your rights aren’t being taken from you. What if “for safety” we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens? What if we decided that TSA should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the US, creating 2 hour delays? What if we decided that anyone that supports Trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning? Do you see where this goes? 
I don’t like the immigration ones inside the states of the Southwest, I don’t like the “agricultural” ones into California, and I don’t like the DUI checkpoints in the South. I’m a legal resident, don’t transport crops, and don’t drink, yet I oppose all of them. The idea behind them is well-meaning, the execution is unlawful IMO. Obviously the courts don’t think so, or they’d not exist. Gary Honeycutt 
It is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself. He does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk. He stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim, perhaps raping your daughter. What would you do in his place? Mike 
You are confusing the issues here. Zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime. 
DUI checkpoints are 100% stop and question, with zero probable cause. Have you been in states where they run these? The road is barricaded, even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are ASSUMED to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned. You are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint, but the fact that they exist trouble me. As do any checkpoints, as they are not based on probable cause. Gary Honeycutt 
And you’ve seen these checkpoints at 1pm by a suburban Baptist church? No! The probable cause lies In them being near “the strip” at 1am where there is a history of alcohol-related incidents. Mike 
I lived in the South, these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as I could tell, and while not at 1PM that I can recall, they weren’t that late, and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church. I could have been naive about who was being targeted (I wasn’t just waived through once they saw my skin color), but my point is that the location doesn’t matter, nor does the target demographic, if there is one. They are unjust, and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement, does not serve to increase the safety of LEO’s. 
If police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart, or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid, I do not have a problem with that. They have probable cause, and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it, because they may be stopping a criminal. Stop me, detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove I am or am not who they are looking for, then let me be on my way. 
However, I’ve been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red (perfectly legal in my state) and the officer was a complete ass. Enough that had I a short fuse, it could have quickly escalated. After that encounter, and talking with the state about why the previously posted “no turn on red sign” had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months, the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop, and threatening that they could have written me up and I would have to prove in court I didn’t break the law, just proved to me that SOME police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances. That officer had no reason to stop me (although I suspect since it was near his house, and he is a rural county officer, he couldn’t control his road rage) and by doing so, he put himself at risk, as well as me. There are a million “what ifs” in that situation, not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark, along a fairly rural road, by himself, he didn’t call in the stop, which is procedure for that department. I could have ended up shot, or he could have, and dispatch would have never known. 
Increasing negative interaction with the public, is never in a LEO’s best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole. dufas_duck 
I guess that’s why the police looking for a skinny Black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is 6 foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short 5foot 5 kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace. Turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off. 
Police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly A-OK. 
In the town that I live in, police shot and killed a 15 year old kid while he slept… Maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets, he could have emptied his clip… 
Maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money. A couple of bullets is cheaper than some cop’s time to find out what really is going on.. 
Of course, some of those evil people’s relitives will probably sue, but so what, the tax payers will take care of that.. 
How do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses, gets arrested for your ‘non-compliance’… 
You would love my uncle. He was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone. After about fifteen years of bullying, beating, killing, and making false charges against people, the force finally fired him…meanwhile, he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused, it was anybody he could screw with… 
But, in your mind, police can do no wrong..maybe you are right, police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong, especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation….. Gary Honeycutt 
I don’t deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldn’t be or wrong split-second decisions sometimes. Think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from. Think about the number of times per day that an LEO comes in contact with a citizen. That taken into account, bad contacts are extremely rare. The sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they don’t consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are. The incidents don’t sour me on the entire education system. We need law enforcement. You are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution? Will any form of policing be perfect? What is? dufas_duck 
How about having honest police and policing. While percentage wise, there is a small number of truley bad cops….. But, [there is always a but]… A large percentage of your ‘good’ cops will keep silent, lie, or even cover for the bad cops. That extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces. Those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careers..cops don’t like whistleblowers. 
The example you used, teachers having sex with students is perfect. Once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line, even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses. Not so within the police. A bad policeman can get away with things multiple times, sometimes going on for years. The upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn. Even if convicted, the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment. 
For years, the public was kept in the dark about ‘the bad cop’. Very few were brought to justice. Only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated. It is just lately, after public attention, that the police are starting to somewhat clean house. 
There are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers. Many are just put on probation, others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration. 
It would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system. A legal system can be whatever it’s practicinors want it to be. A justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to. Quilified and absolute immunity for police, DAs, judges does not lend itself to anything close to ‘justice’….. 
Police are a necessary evil…the are some evil people in the world, it is just too bad that many of them are police officers. Gary Honeycutt 
Keep silent, lie, or even cover? Turn off the TV and go out i to the world. Some will agree with you but if you’d said the same thing about black people there’d be trouble. Don’t you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules? They also don’t like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple. Do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime? Probably, but more so than the general population? Interesting take on the teacher thing. I remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school. He was no prize in his youth and I guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldn’t resist. She got pregnant. And to add to a volatile situation, her uncle was the superintendent of schools! Flash ahead maybe 10 years give or take and I’m a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school. I work with a married couple, both tenured teachers, probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired, downsized, transferred, or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers. The hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle. Guess who? Yep! dufas_duck 
I’ve been out in the world for over 75 years. Been beat by cops and then have them later discover I wasn’t the perp they were looking for. I was only lucky in that the cops didn’t make up charges to cover their tails., they just lied about what went down and covered for each other. In this instance, everything happened because I was driving the same make, model, color, and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime. On the way to jail, a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down, the perp had been caught and identified. The cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle…. 
I think if you would re-read what I posted, It was the cops that I refered to as being giged for turning in another cop, not the teachers. In todays world, a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer. If you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids, I don’t think you would have lasted in that position…unless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you??? Gary Honeycutt 
No, I wasn’t referring to myself. I was an outsider where the good ol’ boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll. I think the guy in my story should’ve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again. dufas_duck 
Addendum: 
I get the feelig[?] that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake, the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes. Police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions. Even in the military, soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up, the soldier faces the consequenses… But, there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is A-OK. Like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood, knocking on doors and a 13 year old kid opens the door while holding a PS3 game controller. Cop shouts gun and 13 shots later…an innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the Playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass…. That’s the kind of policing that you want?? 
Yet, a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent person…the mechanic can be held liable… Both were mistakes…why should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be?? Anthony Fredericks 
There’s NO EXCUSE for killing a person Gary!!! We have laws against that! No “i’m Sorry” brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops. NO! GARY! accidents like that are NOT! EXCUSABLE!!! I don’t care what job you have. Soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder. Why would it be o.k. for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it??? Gary Honeycutt 
Self-defense is a valid reason, and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs. People like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker. Should only MMA champions be allowed to be cops? An unarmed attacker can kill you. If someone breaks into my house at night I will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family, I will not wait to see if he’s armed or ask his intentions. I won’t refrain from using a weapon because I don’t see him with one. It is not a high school wrestling match. We won’t get up and shake hands after it is decided by score. If this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once I will call a cop. It is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation I was in when someone invaded my home. fluffnik 
I live in Scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns, mostly no-one dies. Anthony Fredericks 
You mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his I.D. to the cop? Or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his Autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air? How about those huh GARY!?!?!? I could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees…. Anthony Fredericks 
SO Gary if I seen you walking towards me on the street, Got scared because you LOOKED dangerous and I “accidentally” defended myself by blowing your head off, Then all I have to say is “oh, sorry my bad” and because accidents happen everything is o.k. right? Take your head out of the sand…Police kill people when they think their AUTHORITY is being challenged not their lives. They are protecting their ego’s. Mike 
While I won’t disagree completely with your statement, blanket statements are never correct. SOME police may kill from challenges to authority. In most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we, not being in the exact same position, should not second guess. What we SHOULD be second-guessing, are the supervisors, chiefs, and elected officials who hire bad cops, improperly train their officers, and put officers in harms way where they should not be. The higher-ups NEVER pay the price for those under them, whose actions they are responsible for. That is a very real problem. If we want change, we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them. 
Programs such as stop and frisk, checkpoints, etc., all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur. That puts officers and the public’s lives at risk, neither is acceptable. The easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur. But you do something stupid (Michael Brown) you deserve what you get. 
I wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims. There are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused. But when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs, you expose your cause as being about something other than justice. Gary Honeycutt 
You can put that example back where you pulled it from…if your head isn’t in the way. BJ 
That’s actually standard in every part of the world except USA. It’s normal for police to protect and serve – it is not normal for police to shoot first, ask later… Jack McCauley 
Will someone hurry and inform the USA… jeeeez, it’s embarassing.. TroothFairy"

"title: Comment on The Working Class Won The Election — Paul Craig Roberts by Debbie Menon author: Debbie Menon text: By Paul Craig Roberts on November 9, 2016 It seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Donald Trump has won a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, defying Republican and Democratic political elites with his populist “Drain the Swamp” and “Make America Great Again” movement. 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. 
Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran. 
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump’s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. 
Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. 
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington’s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia’s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington’s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. 
Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington’s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. 
Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” Wars 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. 
Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still pull off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. 
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people’s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won’t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. 
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media’s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. 
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

A DONALD Trump supporter listened carefully to the president-elect’s call for national unity before registering the domain name for a white supremacist website. 
Brent Logan, from Ohio, paid $19.99 for aryanknightsofamerica.net and said he hoped it would be a website for all Americans, ‘except the black, hispanic, Asian, Muslim and Jewish ones’. 
He added: “But they’re not American anyway. Which is what President Trump has been saying all along. 
“Which us why his call for national unity is so important. He wants to unify us against blacks, hispanics, Asians, Muslims and the Jews. 
“He is a very good public speaker.” 
Logan continued: “It’s going to be very much an Aryan lifestyle website. Fashion tips for intimidating minorities at a picnic; how to decorate your basement with flags, that sort of thing.”

"title: Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras author: Eric Zuesse text: Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras By Eric Zuesse Of course, one of Hillary Clinton’s proudest claims is that as the U.S. Secretary of State she championed reproductive choice throughout the world. She championed it in words, but her actions were sometimes in the opposite direction, and there is perhaps no nation where her actions as the U.S. Secretary of State had a bigger impact than Honduras, which case will therefore be examined, and her impact on this documented, here: The reason that the morning-after pill, which enables raped women to avoid becoming pregnant from a rape, was made illegal by the government that now exists in Honduras, is that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton persuaded President Barack Obama not to terminate U.S. financial aid to the coup-regime that came into power there on 28 June 2009. Without that aid, the democratically elected President would quickly have been restored. Though the U.S. Ambassador in Honduras told Secretary of State Clinton that there was no way in which that coup was legal and that consequently it undoubtedly was a “coup” and that existing U.S. law therefore required U.S. funding of the Honduran government to cease immediately, she ignored the law, and she ignored everything except her friend Lanny Davis the lobbyist whom the coup-plotters had hired to represent them to Democrats (a different lobbyist was hired to represent them to the congressional Republicans). President Obama took his Secretary of State’s advice and refused to enforce the law, and Hillary Clinton publicly praised what the regime was doing. The regime was condemned throughout Latin America, because the coup, which consisted of the local aristocracy or ‘oligarchs’, overthrew the democratically elected President of Honduras, who had wanted a land-reform law to be introduced. Immediately after the coup that overthrew him, the newly installed regime allowed the aristocrats’ paid thugs to murder anyone who tried to lead the opposition; and therefore the regime that had been imposed by Honduras’s aristocracy and kept in power by America’s aristocracy, has remained stable since. However, after the coup, Honduras has had the world’s highest murder-rate. Thus, it’s a stable but now extraordinarily violent country. (Detailed documentation of every allegation in this paragraph can be found in the “Honduras” section of this article I earlier wrote about “Hillary Clinton’s Six Foreign-Policy Catastrophes” ; and that section on Honduras, in turn, links to 68 sources, which provide the sometimes gruesome details regarding Hillary Clinton’s impact upon the lives of the Honduran people since the coup. However, that article didn’t mention this matter concerning contraception, rape, and abortion; and, so, the present article will be an extension from that earlier one, dealing specifically with Hillary Clinton’s impact upon family-planning and reproductive choice in Honduras.) One feature of the new, U.S.-backed, regime, was the imposition of draconian fundamentalist laws against contraception and intensifying the abortion-ban. On 13 February 2012, the Center for Reproductive Rights headlined “Honduras Supreme Court Upholds Absolute Ban on Emergency Contraception, Opens Door to Criminalize Women and Medical Professionals” and reported: The Honduras Supreme Court has upheld the country’s absolute ban on emergency contraception, which would criminalize the sale, distribution, and use of the “morning-after pill” — imposing punishment for offenders equal to that of obtaining or performing an abortion, which in Honduras is completely restricted. “By banning and criminalizing emergency contraception, Honduras is telling the world it would rather imprison the women of its country than provide them with safe and effective birth control,” said Luisa Cabal, director of international legal programs at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Today’s decision from the Honduras Supreme Court blatantly disregards women’s fundamental reproductive rights and completely ignores the respected medical opinion of experts around the globe. It will cause significant harm in the lives countless women and doctors across the country. … Consequently, the hell in Honduras has been accentuated by punishment of women who have been raped, and punishment of doctors and pharmacists who try to help them. The President whom Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the ten main aristocratic families of Honduras , overthrew and prohibited from running for President ever again, Manuel Zelaya, had, in April 2009, vetoed a law that the Honduran legislature (controlled by those ten families plus another 15 or so ) had just passed to ban the morning-after pill. So, that law didn’t enter into force until the U.S.-imposed regime restored it. However, the restoration of the ban wasn’t final until this decision was handed down by the Honduran Supreme Court. As Amnesty International said at that time : On 1 February, the Supreme Court in Honduras upheld a decree imposing an absolute ban on emergency contraception. This decree was vetoed in May 2009 by the former President on grounds that it conflicted with the Constitution. The Supreme Court has now concluded that the decree is constitutional and that Congress can begin to develop laws enforcing a ban of the emergency contraceptive pill on the basis of its alleged “abortive” nature. The World Health Organization, Pan-American Health Organization, and several other expert bodies have clearly stated that the emergency contraceptive pill is not abortive; it is a form of contraception that works by ensuring the egg is inaccessible and impeding fertilization. The criminalization of the emergency contraceptive pill will have appalling consequences. For example, rape victims will be unable to prevent pregnancy … And so it has been in Honduras. During the period since the 28 June 2009 Honduran U.S.-backed coup, the hell in Honduras has been so bad that Honduras has become one of the top sources of illegal immigration into the United States. The world-record-high murder-rates and crushing poverty, with no opportunity for the public to ‘move up in the world’ other than through becoming one of the paid enforcers for the aristocrats, which often also entails leading the now-booming drug-gangs there, has essentially forced out of Honduras millions of residents, and many of them have escaped through Mexico into the United States, in order to be able to have a decent life, rather than murder and be murdered. Hillary Clinton’s opponent in the U.S. Presidential campaign, Donald Trump, never talks about the hell that Clinton and Obama have been imposing around the world (except regarding non-Christian-majority countries such as Libya), and he seems to view illegal immigrants as if U.S. foreign policies have nothing to do with creating the problems that those people are facing, but there is no indication that he would continue those policies, which have been causing them to be illegal immigrants here. To the contrary, his anti-interventionist foreign-policy proposals would be inconsistent with coups and invasions regarding any foreign country whose government is not posing an imminent threat to U.S. national security. Trump’s foreign-policy proposals are not in any way favorable toward those of Hillary Clinton (who is simply an extreme version of Obama’s worst policy-orientations). (And America’s own Federation of American Scientists has stated that Obama is lying in order to ‘justify’ his policy now to ignore existing in-force nuclear treaties with Russia as being supposedly not violations of them. So, though he may not be as much of a neoconservative as she is, he basically is one, too. His aggression against Russia is subtle , but forceful .) Consequently, at least regarding foreign policy, a President Trump would be authentic change, irrespective of whether a particular voter would approve of that change as opposed to continuing America’s existing foreign policy but in a more extreme way. Among other things, a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to retain the status-quo in Honduras and around the world, but to go much farther in the same direction. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to change that status-quo — to change (and in some important respects reverse ) that direction . The biggest impact of this election will be on foreign (including both economic and military) policy. Even domestically within the United States, the difference between the two candidates on foreign policies will have a much bigger impact, including possibly even nuclear war , than will the other policy-areas, which the general public erroneously think will have a bigger impact upon their lives and their future than will foreign policies. (And here are quoted recent reports in the Washington Post , Spiegel , Huffington Post , and other serious media, discussing her preparing her coming Administration’s plans and personnel for a war with Russia; and Obama is right now setting everything up for her to be able to start the war as soon as possible.) Regardless of whether the American public know it, the main impact of this Presidential election will be on foreign policy, including on the immense impacts that foreign policy will have domestically. So: this is not the time when the U.S. will be progressing but instead regressing, and intelligent voters will be aiming to minimize the harms, rather than to achieve progress. Progress, at this stage so late in the game, is still being hoped-for only by some fools who happen to be also progressives. Any intelligent progressive, at this late stage, is focused entirely upon minimizing the harm. And the maximum harm could happen with surprising rapidity. (Back in 1961, the estimation of experts was that — as one of the few who spoke publicly stated — “A nuclear war between the United States and Russia would be all over in 24 or 48 hours because both sides would let go with their full atomic arsenals.” The estimates today are far more precise but unpublished, and they’re all well under an hour — some as low as 20 minutes.) There wouldn’t be any surrender, nor any armistice. There would only be the end of civilization , and unspeakable misery (including details that are ignored by the major media, such as this ) until practically everyone is dead (from starvation if nothing else). Those are the stakes in this election. Even to be debating domestic issues at a time like this, simply doesn’t make any sense. But the situation in Honduras points up the ridiculousness, in a fundamentally different context, which is why I am writing about it now."

"title: Peaceful Hillary Supporter Destroys Hollywood Trump Star author: The European Union Times text: 
A Hillary Clinton goon destroyed Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The “peaceful man” said that he had 4-5 family members assaulted and that hes terrible upset that he has a presidential nominee who is a “poster child for sexual violence”. People were standing around and filming his “brave act”, we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this, yet no one intervened, no one called the cops.
Most of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that Trump is a rapist.
This is a classic tactic from Saul Alinsky of whom Hillary Clinton idolized and based her college thesis on. Divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent. Nice!
So Hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husband’s rapes of multiple women with false accusations of Trump. Make no mistake about it, this is not a Trump issue. She would have done the same thing with any other opponent. If it were Ted Cruz, same story, if he would have exposed Bill Clinton’s rapes, the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing Ted Cruz of raping and groping them. Unbelievable!
The vandal identified himself as James Otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by Trump.
You would think that in the light of Project Veritas videos and how they exposed the DNC evil who paid agitators, violence, voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope, the viciousness is going on. These people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana-boy Obama but if Trump gets in, a lot of people are RIGHTFULLY going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos, anarchy and lawlessness.
LAPD is currently searching for the vandalism suspect.
Trump received his star in 2007. In July 2016 a protester built a 6-inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest, but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the Democrats who paid him to do that.
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said they are planning to repair the star. Well at least they have some honor in them.
“People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property” the chamber’s president said.
These sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like America which brags to the world how it is “the greatest democracy in the world” it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow.
If it has come to the point that even the communist state press in China is saying that what the media in America is doing to Trump is pure bias, then we know how bad it is in America.
The media people in America are rubbing their hands at this one. They are truly happy and excited this happened.

"title: 'Russia has no intention of attacking anyone -this is absurd,' says Vladimir Putin author: Angela Borozna text: October 28, 2016 112 While the Western press continues scaring its public of ""Russian aggression"" and blaming Russia for influencing the 2016 American presidential elections, Vladimir Putin just made a speech that is unlikely to appear in any mainstream media. Share on Facebook 
At the meeting of experts at the Valdai Club in Sochi on October 27, Putin said about the U.S. elections: “a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.” 
Putin called U.S. stories of “Russian hacking the U.S. election” as a “mythical and imaginary problem” and “the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election,” instead of focusing on the domestic issues: 
“The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.” 
“Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.” 
Putin reminded us who the real rulers are: 
“The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.” 
Referring to the Western elites’ downplaying the growing gap between rich and poor, Putin said: 
“It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favor of the suzerain.” 
Putin reminded everyone that current situation of instability in the world is a direct result of the choice made by the United States after the end of the Cold War to take “the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.” By taking this course, the U.S. missed a chance to make globalization “more harmonious and sustainable in nature.” 
In their euphoria of winning the Cold war, the United States “essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalization and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.” 
This victorious attitude led to the system of international relations where “rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. “ 
On the Western hypocrisy and double talk, Putin said: 
“If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.” 
Russian president reminded about the U.S.-led decision “to launch airstrikes in the center of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya,” and turning the UN into a tool of U.S. foreign policy: 
“The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favor these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defense systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.” 
In the global economy, multilateral institutions also became a tool to promote the interests of few: 
“We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organization and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organization itself aside and build a new one instead.” 
Always referring to the U.S. as “some of our partners,” Putin stressed that they “demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today.” Instead of making OSCE, “a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security,” it was shaped into “an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests.” 
About constant vilification of Russia and trumpeting of “Russian aggression,” Putin said: “they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. 
Of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilization against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. 
It is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. 
The question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?’ "

“ Before Comey’s letter to Congress, Clinton’s campaign had watched with mixed feelings as her standing in poll after poll improved and Trump faltered amid a string of sexual assault accusations. ‘In the last week, I think the Clinton campaign was worried it was going to become too easy and that people would feel that,’ said Mo Elleithee, who worked on Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential campaign. ‘Now there’s a reason for all of our supporters to believe it’s going to be hard.'”

"title: Does the Russian Government Have a Reality Disconnect? - Paul Craig Roberts author: nan text: Originally appeared at Paul Craig Roberts 
During the decades-long Cold War the belief in America was that the Soviet Union had an ideology of world domination. Every nationalist movement, such as Vietnam’s effort to throw off French colonialism, was misinterpreted as another domino falling to Soviet world conquest. This mistaken American belief persisted despite Stalin’s purge of the Trotsky elements that preached world revolution. Stalin declared: “socialism in one country.” 
As the Soviets did not have the aim that the US attributed to them, the two governments could cooperate in reducing the dangerous tensions that nuclear weapons presented. 
The rise of the American neoconservatives and their doctrine of US world hegemony has given the United States the expansionist ideology formerly attributed to the Soviets. Only this time the expansionist ideology is real. Yet, Russia’s foreign minister, Lavrov, said today that “we [the US and Russia] have no ideological differences which make the Cold War inevitable.” https://sputniknews.com/politics/201610251046697689-lavrov-russia-cold-war/ 
The inability of the Russian government to understand that the neoconservative ideology of US world hegemony is the driving force of US foreign policy leaves Lavrov puzzled at the high level of hostility toward Russia. As Lavrov believes that there are no ideological differences between the two countries, he doesn’t understand the hostility. However, he does understand that this hostility toward Russia is a negation of Cold War rules that both countries avoid surprising the other with what could be perceived as a dangerous threat. 
There is no sign that the US government understands the danger in Russia’s perception of threat or that Washington cares."
"title: Frau von Maus aufgefressen, weil sie nicht sofort kreischend auf Stuhl gesprungen ist author: noreply@blogger.com (Der Postillon) text: Dienstag, 8. November 2016 Frau von Maus aufgefressen, weil sie nicht sofort kreischend auf Stuhl gesprungen ist Remscheid (Archiv) - Es ist eine Tragödie, die leicht hätte verhindert werden können: Eine 43-jährige Frau ist heute im nordrhein-westfälischen Remscheid in ihrer eigenen Wohnung von einer Maus angegriffen und grausam zerfleischt worden. Nach Polizeiangaben hatte es die Frau leichtsinnigerweise unterlassen, rechtzeitig auf einen rettenden Stuhl zu springen und zu kreischen. Wie aus dem Polizeibericht hervorgeht, bereitete das Opfer Susanne B. gerade gemeinsam mit einer Freundin Essen zu, als das Nagetier ohne jede Vorwarnung in der Küche erschien. Daraufhin rettete sich die 38-jährige Freundin der Frau geistesgegenwärtig sofort auf einen Stuhl und versuchte, das Tier mit lautem Kreischen zu verjagen. So kann nichts passieren. Susanne B. hingegen sei unbeeindruckt stehengeblieben und habe erklärt, es handle sich nur um eine ""völlig ungefährliche Maus"", die ""niemandem"" etwas zuleidetue – laut dem Bericht ihre letzten Worte, bevor sie von dem Tier angefallen und vor den Augen ihrer entsetzten Freundin zerfleischt und gefressen wurde. Als die von der Freundin verständigte Polizei in Begleitung eines Notarztes eintraf, waren von Susanne B. nur noch eine Blutlache und einige Kleidungsfetzen übrig. Die Maus war spurlos verschwunden. Um tödliche Mausangriffe wie diesen zu verhindern, raten Experten, beim Erblicken einer Maus sofort ein erhöhtes Möbelstück (Stuhl, Sofa, Schrank) zu erklimmen und dort auszuharren, bis sich die blutrünstige Bestie wieder verzogen hat. Biologen zufolge können Mäuse nämlich nicht klettern, weil ihre Krallen ausschließlich auf das Aufschlitzen und Zerteilen von Menschen ausgelegt sind. Auch möglichst hysterisches Kreischen hilft bei der Abwehr der herkömmlichen Hausmaus, die aufgrund der Größe ihrer Ohren derartige Töne im oberen Frequenzbereich nicht verträgt. In Remscheid wird derzeit noch nach der flüchtigen Maus gefahndet, Polizisten mit Katzenstaffeln patroullieren seit dem frühen Nachmittag in der Nachbarschaft. Der Augenzeugin zufolge ist die Gesuchte grau-braun, etwa ein bis drei Jahre alt und hat dunkle Augen. Sachdienliche Hinweise an die zuständige Polizeidienstelle werden mit bis zu 200 Euro belohnt. fed, ssi, dan; Fotos: Shutterstock; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 5.11.15 Artikel teilen:"

"title: Georgia Abandons Ukraine's Anti-Russian Obsession - Archil Sikharulidze author: nan text: Your daily reality snack Georgia Abandons Ukraine's Anti-Russian Obsession 
After a brief period in which both Ukraine and Georgia appeared to be united against Russia, it now appears that the two nations are moving along very different paths Originally appeared at Russia Direct 
In October, Georgia didn’t support any of Ukraine’s resolutions denouncing the Kremlin’s foreign policy within the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). That is surprising, given how many analysts had by now assumed that Georgia and Ukraine were on the same page when it came to Russia. 
The two resolutions deal with “the political implications of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine” and human rights abuses “on the occupied Ukrainian territories.” By supporting them, PACE recognized the military conflict in Ukraine as “Russian aggression” for the first time and called on the Kremlin to withdraw its forces from the eastern part of Ukraine. Moreover, it denounced the parliamentary elections , recently conducted by Russia in Crimea . 
When the Georgian delegation in PACE didn’t support these resolutions, the nation’s pro-Western parties reacted strongly. For example, the United National Movement lambasted the Georgian government and accused the country’s former Prime Minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, of supporting Russia. Moreover, Mikheil Saakashvili, the former Georgian president and now the governor of the Odessa region in Ukraine, described such a stance as a “disgraceful” move. 
However, an immediate response came from one of the members of the Georgian delegation in PACE, Eka Beselia. She retorted that Tbilisi needed to defend its own national interests. Even though this statement seems to have alleviated the increasing conflict, the video of Russian-Ukrainian journalist Matwey Ganapolsky, who accuses Georgia of betraying Ukraine in favor of Russia, fuelled the tensions. In contrast, Russian pundits see the unwillingness of Georgia to vote for the PACE resolution as a sign of improvement in Tbilisi-Moscow relations. 
In reality, the reluctance of the Georgian Dream, the ruling party in Georgia, to approve these resolutions is just the logical conclusion of complicated relations with Kiev. Since the start of the color revolutions in the post-Soviet space , Georgia and Ukraine were largely in the same boat. 
After the success of the Rose Revolution in Tbilisi and the Orange Revolution in Kiev, the newly elected governments were closely connected with each other and teamed up against Russia. This resulted from friendly relations between Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Timoshenko and former president Viktor Yushchenko on the one hand, and Georgia’s Saakashvili on the other hand. 
However, their relationship was rather pragmatic in its nature, although officially Tbilisi recognized Ukraine as one of its closest allies. Since 2007 the democratic processes in the two countries have started moving in a reverse direction. Saakashvili’s penchant for conducting an aggressive policy as well as his authoritarian inclinations was increasing, while Ukraine faced the corruption and the political rivalry between Timoshenko and Yushchenko. 
The more impact this had on the countries’ stability and development, the more obvious became the fact that the ruling elites from both sides did not support democratic reforms, but only the regimes that were friendly to them. Thus, Georgian-Ukrainian relations could be seen as a form of cooperation between governments, not between the people. 
And this trend became relevant until the 2010 presidential elections, when Georgia’s civil society and population called on the government to support democratic processes and regime change in its “brother” country. From then on, Georgia has been shying away from supporting the political regime in Ukraine and focusing more on the support of the country’s own population. 
However, Ukraine refused to consider such tactics, with its official representatives criticizing the Georgian Dream coalition for supporting Russia during the 2012 parliamentary elections. Moreover, Kiev cooperated with Georgia’s United National Movement, which was openly accused of building an authoritarian regime and egregious human rights abuses. 
Logically, the new Georgian government under Ivanishvili cannot help paying attention to this fact. But it was relatively reticent and didn’t respond, even when Georgian volunteers came to fight in Eastern Ukraine to support Kiev and accused Tbilisi of supporting Russia. That had some implications for the Georgian Dream: It was seen as a political force that is capable of defending the country’s national interests. 
Moreover, Georgian voters also saw the fact that Saakashvili was appointed as the governor of the Odessa region as an unfriendly move from Ukraine, as a slap in the face, because the former Georgian president was legally prosecuted in his home country, which meant that Ivanishvili couldn’t fulfill his pledges and restore justice [During the election campaign he promised to put Saakashvili in jail for corruption and the abuse of power — Editor’s note]. The problem was exacerbated when Kiev granted Saakashvili Ukrainian citizenship, which made it impossible to imprison the former Georgian president. 
Saakashvili crossed the red line during the latest parliamentary elections in Georgia during the campaign. First, his colleagues from the United National Movement visited Ukraine. Second, he openly called for a coup d’état against the Georgian government, which he sees as pro-Russian. In fact, he threatened to conduct a new revolution in Georgia. This was the last straw for the Georgian Dream. 
It is safe to say that the current Georgian political elites started seeing Ukraine as a real headache and the shelter for dubious and controversial Georgian politicians from the United National Movement accused of different wrongdoings and legal violations. 
However, with the victory of the Georgian Dream in the 2016 parliamentary elections, a lot has changed. Moreover, the odds of the party of winning the constitutional majority are really high. It means that the influence of the party is growing in the Georgian parliament and even more could change. 
As a result, the government won’t necessarily have to take into account the views of other political forces to take decisions. It can be pretty outspoken now that it won’t put up with anti-government moves and initiatives like the ones promoted by Saakashvili. Moreover, the Georgian voters, who are seeking to have those involved in the violations during Saakashvili’s tenure prosecuted. So, in this regard, the electorate supports the Georgian Dream. 
Thus, all this indicates that Georgian-Ukrainian relations have always been more complex and nuanced than they seemed to be at first glance. During Saakashvili’s tenure, there was cooperation between his government and the ones of Timoshenko and Yushchenko. However, eventually, Tbilisi shifted its priority from supporting top political officials to supporting society and people. 
Ukrainian politicians should keep in mind that the Russian factor is not the only one that determines the Ukrainian-Georgian agenda. Providing shelter to Saakashvili also does matter. So, to improve the relations with Tbilisi, Kiev should take into account its national interest and support the Georgian people instead of the country’s politicians."
"title: nan author: Enjoykin4 text: A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”"
"title: It’s Not Over Yet: “They May Be Trying To Steal Arizona And Michigan” | Calls For Electoral College To Ignore Will Of People author: Mac Slavo text: 
You didn’t think she’d go down without a fight did you?
The Clinton campaign is clawing it’s way to what they hope may land Hillary in the White House. Though Clinton officially conceded the race to Trump on Wednesday morning, a concession is not legally binding. During the 2000 election Al Gore conceded to George Bush on the night of the election, only to begin court proceedings a few short hours later to contest the results and initiate recounts.
According to Jim Stone , the race between Trump and Clinton may not be over just yet:
They may be trying to steal Arizona and Michigan, and then use special powers to flip 9 electoral votes away from Trump. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY HAVE REFUSED TO MAKE THEIR TOTALS OFFICIAL. THIS IS NOT OVER YET 
…
Trump won Arizona. Why has it not been made official? Trump won Michigan. Why has it not been made official? They are calling the counts “unofficial,” WHY?
Election officials in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire are still counting votes. The vote differentials while the counts conclude are so close that Clinton could potentially inch out a win with early voting ballots and provisional ballots. The small difference in votes in most of these states could trigger recounts. And given what we know about the Clinton campaign, we suspect that any recount would bring with it the real possibility of “uncounted votes” being discovered in back closets, much like we saw in Florida during the 2000 election debacle. 
Newsweek confirms that Clinton still has a chance:
AP analyst Michael McDonald says he is skeptical that Trump won Wisconsin, as the AP projected. If that state flips for Clinton and she wins the other toss-up states, she and Trump could be in a tie at 269 votes each .
“Maybe Clinton actually wins Wisconsin,” McDonald says. “Look, just because the media calls something does not mean that that’s actually the outcome of the election.”
In that event that neither candidate hits the 270 electoral vote threshold, the vote for President would be passed on to the Repoublican controlled House of Representatives and the vote for Vice President would be put before the Senate, also controlled by Republicans.
One might say this is a no-brainer, except we have two words: #NEVERTRUMP.
The NeverTrump movement, started by conservatives and championed publicly and privately by sitting U.S. Congressional leaders, could potentially steal the win right out from under Donald Trump.
Though unlikely, it remains a distinct possibility. 
And never to go without a Plan B, as John Podesta hinted on election night , Clinton has a second option, which involves targeting the electoral college directly.
Change.org has already filed a petition that includes 361,000 signatures as of this writing asking members of red States’ Electoral College to turn on the will of the people of their state and cast a vote for Hillary instead of Trump. The situation would not be unprecedented, as there have been 157 “faithless electors” since the inception of the College in 1787. None of those faithless votes ever resulted in a significant shift in the election. Electors are bound by most states to cast the vote for their pledged party and failure to do so comes with fines and, in some cases, jail time.
What it boils down to is that Hillary could conceivably flip 10 Electors to her side, however unlikely of a scenario that is:
Petition Excerpt: 
On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! 
We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?
Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic.
Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.
Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump “won” is because of the Electoral College.
But the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?
We can fully expect Hillary Clinton to push, even if she does so from behind the scenes.
We expect that within hours or days the push from the liberal media will be widespread and the thousands of protesters taking over major cities across America will be calling for recounts, faithless electoral votes and revolution.
It’s definitely not over until the electoral votes are cast on December 19.

Don’t bother pointing out how incredibly dim-witted it is to pause a losing campaign just days away from Election Day to open up a luxury hotel to the Republican nominee, Trump doesn’t want to hear it. 
After inexplicably spending a day participating in an opening ceremony for a new Trump Hotel in Washington DC, its namesake was in no mood to discuss his failing campaign. CNN’s Dana Bash learned that the hard way when she asked the question on everyone’s mind: What were you thinking? 
Rather than answer, Trump threw a hissy fit. 
“I say the following: You have been covering me for the last — long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight,” Trump said. 
“For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising? Donald Trump: “No, not at all” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
For those keeping score that short answer checks a lot of boxes: Whining about the media Flagrant conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton’s health Groundless accusation that asking a simple question is “rude” No answer whatsoever 
Trump may be testy due to his slow realization that his campaign is under water, he has no practical way forward, and it would take a miracle to win. 
Instead of even trying, he seems to be retreating to the things he knows will make him money after the election. His campaign recently launched the prototype to “Trump TV,” a daily live stream filled with confused campaign staffers, shameless opportunists and Rudy Giuliani. He also seems desperate to salvage his failing properties, something that may not be possible after running a campaign that offended practically every group in America. 
Already there are signs that Trump’s hotels have taken a hit. Yahoo explains : Rates for rooms at Trump’s new D.C. hotel are being slashed as travelers weigh their options, and smartphone data suggest fewer people are visiting his properties compared to rival venues nearby. The Republican nominee for president is in danger of losing not just the election, but something dear to a man who claims the marketing value of his name alone is worth $3 billion: the many customers, mostly wealthy, who have stayed at his hotels, played a round at his golf courses or held galas at his oceanside resorts. 
Trump may find that his bigotry has cost him not only the election, but the fortune he valued more than his reputation as well.

Earlier this summer, Miller had criticized the tone of Comey’s press conference announcing that there was no basis for criminal charges against Hillary. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Miller said that Comey’s decision to “editorialize” Hillary’s behavior was “not grounded in any position in law.” In his Friday tweetstorm, Miller blasted the FBI for sending details of the investigation to Congress. He flagrantly violated DOJ rules with his press conference. Then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to Congress…2/

To Miller’s mind, this paled in comparison to the decision to publicly disclose this latest discovery, given that we are less than two weeks from Election Day. But today's disclosure might be worst abuse yet. DOJ goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election. 5/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Not just public discussion either. Often won't send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over…6/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Why? Because voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Who is the target of an investigation? What conduct? 7/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 This might be totally benign & not even involve Clinton. But no way for press or voters to know that. Easy for opponent to make hay over. 8/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Which takes us back to the original rule: you don't comment on ongoing investigations. Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/

Miller’s hunch was confirmed later in the day as more details dribbled out. It turns out that the FBI discovered these emails while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for inappropriate texts with a minor. The emails were found on a device Weiner shared with his estranged wife, longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin. 
According to NBC News’ Pete Williams, however, there doesn’t appear to be anything that even comes close to a smoking gun–at least for now. Williams discussed his findings on MSNBC on Friday afternoon; watch here, via Jaffy’s Twitter.

— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 
Williams went further in another MSNBC interview later in the afternoon; watch here. 
Williams believes that there are two questions–whether the number of emails changed, and whether anyone withheld evidence. His FBI sources tell him that those emails were not withheld by Hillary or her campaign. Moreover, the emails are not from Hillary. That raises the obvious question–was there any defensible reason to make such a disclosure? 
Miller thinks there wasn’t, and told CNN’s Jake Tapper so later that afternoon. Watch here. 
Miller said that longstanding DOJ practice calls for the department and its various agencies to avoid doing anything that could potentially influence the results of an election within 60 days of Election Day. When Tapper asked Miller if the FBI could have been accused of bias toward Hillary had Comey remained silent, Miller said he didn’t think so in this case because “there’s no information to be released.” That letter never disclosed what triggered this new review, and thus forces Hillary to “defend against a negative.” 
Understandably, Hillary’s campaign wants to know that justified this disclosure from the FBI. Campaign chairman John Podesta issued a burning statement demanding answers from the FBI. Statement from @johnpodesta in response to Comey letter to GOP chairmen pic.twitter.com/egyUMl68ZC

Hillary herself called for an explanation as well while on the stump in Iowa. 
Unless Comey is willing to give an explanation, I can only agree with Miller–this disclosure was grossly inappropriate. About Darrell Lucus

"title: News: Incredibly Selfish: The City Of Chicago Wants Its Baseball Team To Win The World Series Even Though It Already Has A Bunch Of Movie Theaters And A Zoo author: nan text: Email 
If you want to see the full depths of human greed, look no further than the city of Chicago. This week, the residents of this selfish city are marching through the streets rooting for their hometown baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, to win the World Series. Yep, you heard that right. The citizens of Chicago want their baseball team to win the World Series even though their city already has a bunch of movie theaters and a zoo. 
Some people just want more and more and more. 
The endless selfishness on display here is just sickening. Apparently having dozens of movie theaters and a whole zoo to enjoy isn’t enough for the pleasure gluttons of Chicago. They need a big honking World Series victory, too. 
We’ll give you a minute to try to wrap your head around the sheer unbridled avarice of these people. All you have to do is Google “Movie Theaters Chicago,” and you’ll be flooded with the names and addresses of cinemas all over the city playing both mainstream blockbusters and art house gems, which the people of Chicago can go to whenever they want. And when they aren’t in the mood for a movie, these spoiled brats can go see exotic creatures from all over the world at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But apparently that’s not enough to satisfy these unhinged hedonists. No, they need a gigantic parade for the Chicago Cubs cutting right through the middle of their city. They need fountains of champagne and a picture of Anthony Rizzo celebrating on the front page of every major newspaper in the country. 
Hey, Chicago! Maybe if the Cubs win the World Series someone will make a movie about it, and you can go watch it in whichever one of the goddamn dozens of fucking movie theaters in your charmed little city is closest to your house. And then when the movie about your world champion baseball team is over, you can go talk about it while you look at the majestic lowland gorillas that live at your fully functioning goddamn zoo. If you aren’t sickened by what you see in the mirror, Chicago, it’s because greed has warped your minds. 
Some people are just never content, no matter how many blessings life serves to them on a silver platter. Apparently the people in Chicago will not be satisfied unless their brains are gushing dopamine in all directions at all times. They have so many movie theaters. They have a zoo. And yet they won’t be happy until the fucking president of the United States is personally congratulating them for having the best baseball team in the world. Where do they get the gall to desire a World Series victory amid their cornucopia of movie theaters and their zoo? It’s disgusting. Nothing is ever enough for Chicago. 
Fucking ingrates."
"title: The Democratic Debacle – The Day After author: Glen Ford text: 2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
The GOP won at the polls, but Black, brown and working class Democrats have been taking a beating from their own party for decades. “The Democratic Party has failed to deliver even small net increments of social justice to its base constituencies, always giving away more than it gained, and at times taking the lead in savaging the people.” Hillary Clinton hoped to lead a Government of Ruling Class Consensus – a victory only for the One Percent. The Democratic Debacle – The Day After by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
“The net economic loss to the people -- especially the masses of Black folks, who have been stripped of much of the gains of the Sixties and Seventies, and nearly all of their household wealth – has been staggering and unrelenting.” 
The White Nationalists won and Hillary Clinton’s Big Tent, the bastion of the ruling class that Blacks and browns were led to believe was their sanctuary, has ignominiously folded. The media echo chamber smothered the deep, rumbling sounds of the impending quake, allowing only the corporate consensus to be heard outside the precincts of the Deplorables. But Deplorables want good jobs, too, and a future secure from the predations of Mad Capital, if only for their own “kind.” Whites in the “Rust Belt” joined with Confederates to choose their own brand of “lesser evil” – evils being the only items on the duopoly menu. 
Social democrats – a broad group that includes the vast bulk of Black America, according to political scientist Michael Dawson -- huddled around the latrine of Hillary’s Big Tent, trying desperately to perfume the stench. Except for a few percentage points worth of Green voters, they opted, once again, for a fraudulent “incrementalism” – a foolishness dressed up as “pragmatism” and even masquerading as high “strategy” -- which has led “progressives” straight down a road to disaster in the neoliberal era. (My excessive use of quotation marks is intended to convey that even the language of much leftish discourse is crafted for the purpose of surrender to Power.) 
“Whites in the ‘Rust Belt’ joined with Confederates to choose their own brand of ‘lesser evil’ – evils being the only items on the duopoly menu.” 
Rather than gradually strengthening the political hand of the working and oppressed classes, bit by bit, year by year -- which is the purported justification for incrementalism -- progressive slavishness to the Democratic Party has facilitated the deepening dictatorship of capital. The net economic loss to the people -- especially the masses of Black folks, who have been stripped of much of the gains of the Sixties and Seventies, and nearly all of their household wealth – has been staggering and unrelenting. 
For the past 40 years and more, Democrats have been perfect partners in the Dance of the Duopolists. It’s a simple two-step. The basic move is: the Democrats hug as closely as possible to the left flank of the Republican Party, thus staying within dog-whistle range of the White Man’s Party’s core base, rooted in white supremacy, while claiming everything to the left of Robert E. Lee as Democratic turf, including the huge, heavily Black social democratic electorate whose progressive agenda the Democrats have no intention of substantively addressing. 
The Clintons turned this two-step into a disciplined tango with their GOP partners. In 1994, the Republicans threatened to launch a social justice Armageddon through their Contract with America -- legislation they were incapable of fully enacting, however, without some level of Democratic consent. The Clintons vowed to defend Black, brown and poor people from the GOP barbarians at the gate – and wound up ramming through Congress corporate-crafted measures that the Republicans could not have passed on their own. Bill and Hillary cut a rug to that tune for eight years in the White House, stomping out welfare as we knew it, eviscerating Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal banking regulations, presiding over the largest surge in mass Black incarceration in modern history, and delivering the broadcast spectrum to monopoly media, all the while pretending to defend a “progressive agenda.” 
“Islamic jihadists were enlisted en mass as U.S. imperialism’s hellish foreign legion in the Muslim world.” 
On the foreign policy side, the Clintons pioneered Washington’s “humanitarian” military intervention doctrine, later refined by Barack Obama and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bill Clinton set in motion the worst genocide since World War Two, a holocaust that has killed at least six million people under three US. administrations, and still counting. Humanitarian intervention, or Responsibility to Protect (R2P), became Obama’s favored instrument of aggression, a more domestically palatable alternative to George Bush’s massive boots-on-the-ground fiasco in Iraq. Islamic jihadists were enlisted en mass as U.S. imperialism’s hellish foreign legion in the Muslim world. Together, “New” Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton turned Syria and Libya into maelstroms of slaughter and moved towards nuclear war with Russia. 
Obama’s domestic aggressions on behalf of Big Capital were equally bold. With both houses of Congress in Democratic hands and the GOP on the ropes in 2009, he rushed to put Social Security, Medicare and “all entitlements” “on the table” for cutting. Now dancing by himself, not even bothering to triangulate in the Clinton style, Obama tried to forge a “Grand Bargain” with the GOP by pulverizing the remnants of the social safety net. Only the Republicans' institutional imperative to defeat, rather than collaborate with,   -- its white supremacist DNA -- prevented consummation of the Grand Bargain, Obama’s Holy Grail. 
From Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has failed to deliver even small net increments of social justice to its base constituencies, always giving away more than it gained, and at times taking the lead in savaging the people. There is no historical basis in the neoliberal era for the claim that the Democratic Party provides net incremental benefits to Black and working people, or that the party can be seized from its corporate masters and transformed into a machine that fights for the people. It fights for Capital – tooth and nail, as Bernie Sanders’ followers discovered. 
“The First Black President rushed to put Social Security, Medicare and ‘all entitlements’ ‘on the table’ for cutting.” 
Hillary Clinton seized the opportunity presented by the Trump-generated split in the GOP to create a ruling class consensus and headquarters in her own campaign tent. It was the ultimate betrayal, the incubator of a thoroughly corporatized Democratic Party – an undertaker of social democracy. Instead, the White Deplorables derailed her, as they had earlier derailed the Republican corporate establishment. 
Thus, the crisis of legitimacy in U.S. ruling institutions deepens. 
It now appears, in the early hours of President Elect Donald Trump, that the new administration will be a conventional rightwing Republican regime, with a cast of villains including Newt “Contract with America” Gingrich, and a Vice President Mike Pence in the role of Dick “The Real President” Cheney. Maybe Trump will insist on giving peace with Russia and China a chance, maybe not. The Trans Pacific Pipeline is probably dead, unless it can somehow be resurrected in the lame duck session of Congress that begins next week, but there is no way Republicans or Democrats will slap 35 percent tariffs on U.S. corporations’ foreign-produced goods. That’s rhetorical theater a la Trump. 
The Trump regime has no fix for the ills of late stage capitalism that have immiserated both the triumphant Deplorables and the darker folks they scapegoat, and whom they can be counted on to harass, repress and deport. Neither does the Democratic Party, whose next administration, had it not been still-born, would have served the interests of the One Percent even more dependably than did Obama. 
Leave Hillary’s nasty tent in the dirt, where it lies. The people need vibrant social movements that will produce new leadership in struggle and shape the parties of the future. BAR executive editor Glen Ford can be contacted  "
"title: Bulgaria & Moldova Switch from Hillary's Euro-Atlantic Column author: Mark Almond text: Written by Mark Almond   November 13th was as unlucky for stalwart backers of the foreign policy-line embodied by Hillary Clinton just as 8th November was for her domestic supporters. In both Bulgaria and Moldova, the voters rejected candidates for president who had been openly endorsed by Washington and Brussels. Having witnessed how small states with tiny electorates but vital Electoral College votes dealt body-blows to Hillary Clinton's hopes of winning the US Presidency, it would be short-sighted and arrogant - as the Euro-Atlantic establishment has so often been - to dismiss voters in small East European states as irrelevant. Having presumed that Bulgaria was irretrievably anchored in the Euro-Atlantic power-structure by its accession to both NATO and the EU, the choice of an openly pro-Russian candidate for president of the country is a wake-up call to Brussels and Washington. Similarly, the Moldovan elite had seemed locked into an ""irreversible"" course as its premier put it to integration - better said subordination - to the Euro-Atlantic model. In both cases, the majority of citizens thought different. Until the implosion of the neo-con regime-change foreign policy embodied by Hillary Clinton and her attack-dog for Eastern Europe, Victoria Neuland, we could have been confident that the heavy-hands of Washington and Brussels would have pressured both Bulgaria and Moldova to reverse such results. Yet even cash inducements like the IMF's sudden dole of US $36 million to the Moldovan regime just six days before the poll could not buy enough support . Even more striking was the Bulgarian public's rejection of the pro-EU candidate who had boasted about how much EU aid to the poverty- stricken Balkan EU member was at stake. What ordinary Bulgarians and Moldovans know, and what the Euro-Atlantic elites and media never admit, is that EU funds have been a motor of the corruption suffocating their economies. Precisely because of the easy pickings EU and IMF cash provides to the ruling elites, they have no incentive to act in the majority's interests. Real reforms are tough to enact and make the people richer not the insiders in the political class. Until Trump's election, the USA and EU deployed their massive power and influence to making any vote against their policy-options seem futile despite popular recognition of how they had gutted the productive aspects of both the Bulgarian and the Moldovan economies. Sunday's elections in both countries may be straws in the wind. They are victories for the genuine people power of the ballot box, not the street-based populism of crowds favoured by Washington and Brussels to impose ""people power"" on the people. It is striking that the Bulgarian premier, Borisov, who is often criticised as ""authoritarian"" by state media in the EU like Deutsche Welle and the BBC as well as by Euronews, immediately resigned. He drew the democratic consequence of his own candidate's defeat. But the premier of Moldova, Filip, who has been boosted by Euronews etc. as a model European, immediately said the popular vote would have no effect on his policies! Even so, the election of advocates of better ties to Russia is a small geo-political earthquake in states NATO and the EU saw as securely-controlled bases for launching anti-Putin policies. No-one has died in these tremors in Bulgaria and Moldova. But the fact that the upheaval has been peaceful through the ballot-box leaves only violence as a viable way of reversing the will of the people. Both Bulgaria in 1997 and Moldova in 2009 saw violent Putsches from the street enthusiastically endorsed in Brussels and Washington as ""People Power"". If the kind of Soros-sponsored protests Americans themselves are now witnessing at home against Trump are switched on in the East European dissident states the counter-explosion could destabilise the whole EU-NATO project in the vast post-Communist region which had seemed willing to lick the West's hand no matter how often the West had imposed destructive poverty-promoting policies. But now it would be unwise to think that the East European dogs can be kicked with impunity. They could turn vicious as the French say and bite back. A change of course in Washington could re-earn the pro-American consensus squandered over the last twenty-five years by the cynical Euro-Atlantic consensus. But can Western elites swallow their pride and learn the lesson of popular alienation. Or will they sink into denial and double-down on the policies which have rendered them despised by ordinary folk who see through phony rhetoric about swallowing touch economic medicine for their own good. East Europeans know that playing the reform politician not the entrepreneur is the way to get rich in their societies. Sadly, a lot of people in the West are coming to a similar conclusion. So the Trump Effect has emboldened the ordinary voters of Eastern Europe to demand that their elite put the people first. Maybe the Donald didn't mean that to be the outflow of his victory in the USA, but that's how people there see it. If the rigid and impoverishing policies promoted by the US-EU consensus cannot be revised, then more results like those in Bulgaria and Moldova can be expected. What should worry the US-EU establishment is that elections are coming in countries which won't be so easy to ignore as small East European states. Next spring, the Dutch and the French vote. The anti-establishment tide in those two important EU and NATO states is running strongly. Years of rhetoric about reform and anti-corruption strategies across the New Europe of the old Soviet bloc coincided with rampant influence-peddling and bribe-taking. ""Drain the Swamp!"" was one of Trump's most effective slogans. Across Europe, it echoes powerfully precisely because of the hypocrisy and cynicism of domestic and Brussels-based elites who talked so loudly about their commitment to the right kind of anti-corruption strategies but, as East Europeans say, have their left hand cupped behind their backs.

"title: Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton’s Campaign? author: Michael Snyder text: Posted by Michael Snyder 
I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. 
In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled “ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside “… 
So what should the Democrats do now? 
If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. 
Who would they choose? 
Let’s take a look at the top five options… 
#1 Tim Kaine 
He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton’s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. 
And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. 
So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. 
#2 Joe Biden 
Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … 
Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. 
Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. 
But according to the vice president, the short answer is “no.” The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. 
Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. 
Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. 
Biden would probably represent the “safest” choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. 
#3 Bernie Sanders 
Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. 
First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. 
Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. 
Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be “another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. 
So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. 
#4 Elizabeth Warren 
Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the “Bernie Sanders” wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. 
So she is definitely a possibility. 
But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as “another McGovern” because of her far left policies. 
#5 Michelle Obama 
One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. 
And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. 
So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. 
Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as “the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled “ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice “… 
The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. 
“When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. “We know she didn’t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” 
If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. 
Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. 
And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. 
In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. 
And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down.

Did you catch that? The laptops that everyone THOUGHT the FBI destroyed were NOT, in fact, destroyed. Anyone who is caught lying has voided their immunity deals. (cough, Cheryl Mills, cough) There are new, not-seen-before emails, even though Clinton said she disclosed them all. It’s goin’ down. Right now. All of those people who were prepared to take one for Team Clinton might want to reconsider. It’s hard to imagine even Teflon-coated Hillary Clinton getting out of this mess.
Watch this video and try to keep from jumping up and down with excitement:

"title: Obama, Clinton and Putin Play on the Same Team-America Has Been Betrayed author: Dave Hodges text: 

Obama and Putin are playing on the same team. They have a mutual goal. A close examination of the facts reveal that Obama is in bed with the Communists and is intent on the destruction of America. Hillary Clinton is part of the same cabal. If you don’t think so, ask yourself how she was able to sell 20% of America’s uranium to the Russians?
This article will demonstrate that B. Obama (Soetoro) is the manifestation of a decades-old plot designed to subvert the leadership of the United States, thus making America vulnerable to being conquered.
Is America Worth Dying For? I loathe the government that we are forced to endure every day, donâ€™t you, with every communication you engage in being monitored by a bunch of government voyeurs? However, I do love my country, the American people and the ideals for which we stand (e.g. one nation under God). Americaâ€™s present government is not worthy of one ounce of respect. However, the American Constitution and our traditions are indeed worth fighting for, but not with Obama at the helm.
I have often wondered if I had been a soldier in the Texan Army, would I have stayed, fought and died at the hands of Santa Annaâ€™s forces at the Alamo? If I had been a defender at Bataan, Wake Island, or Guam, in the early days of World War II and I knew death was certain, would I stand my post to the last minute? I would, if I knew my sacrifice was honorable and my leadership was patriotic and willing to make the same sacrifice.
America Will Soon Stand Alone As I have documented over the past several weeks, America will soon stand alone , with perhaps, only England as our last ally. Europe will soon be under the Russian sphere of control because of energy dependence on Russia. As a result, NATO will disintegrate. China has married their economy to the Russians based upon gas and oil and we will someday soon face their soldiers on the battlefield which will take place in our neighborhoods. Seemingly all of Latin America has turned their backs on the US and is allowing for Russian military bases and accepting Russian military equipment, thus, making a Red Dawn scenario a near certainty.
America stands on the edge of virtual extinction. The only question is whether Putin, after totally destroying the Petrodollar, will allow America to slowly crumble, or use the combined forces of the United Nations (e.g. North Korea, China, Latin America and Russia to invade). Either way, people like ex-CIA agent, Dr. Jim Garrow boldly proclaim that eventually 90% of all Americans will be left dead. And isnâ€™t that figure consistent with the globalist expressed desire to reduce the North American population by 90%?
And how does Obama respond to these threats? He has announced that he is reducing the American military to pre-World War II levels in yet another act of treason against the American people.
Back to the fundamental question, should we stand our ground and fight to the death? The answer is yes. However, I will not follow the psychopathic criminal that is in the White House. If America is to fall, and most of us will perish, we should not fall with a traitor at the helm. Though the heavens may fall, treason must not be allowed to prosper. The man with 11 social security numbers, several names (e.g. Barry Soetero) must not be allowed to remain in power. If I am to fall in defense of my country, I will do so with fellow Americans, not by following some mongrel masquerading as an American.
Obama Is the Soviet Fulfillment of Generations of Planning After Viktor Suvorov, a former Russian intelligence analyst, defected to England, he revealed Russiaâ€™s top-secret plans to attack the United States at some future date after undermining the United States from within through the subversion of their political leadership. Suvorov had worked as a Russian intelligence analyst as well as having worked for the GRU and with elite Russian special forces, Suvorov, warned the Americans ofÂ Russiaâ€™s true intentions Â after the Russian high command had succeeded in getting Pentagon officials to let down their guard and engage in a high level, but mostly one-sided,Â technology transfer . And under the wrong President (i.e. Obama), America would be weakened to the point to where it could not adequately defend herself.
Anatoliy Golitsyn, a high-ranking KGB defector fled to the United States in order to warn Americans about the secret Russian plan to attack the United States. Golitsyn is generally considered to be among the first and most revealing on the subject of the secret Russian plans to attack America after faking the demise of the old Soviet Union. He authored theÂ The Perestroika Deception Â in which Golitsyn wrote about the deceitful intent behind the Leninist strategy which the present-day Communists are actively pursuing as they fake American style democratization efforts in Russia. From within, American leadership would be compromised in key positions, and the fall of America would be orchestrated from within and under the leadership of an Obama type of President. Golitsyn and Suvorov were only two of dozens of Soviet defectors who told exactly the same story dating back to the 1960â€™s.
Obama Is the Pawn of the Russians to Conquer America From the official files of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, we find Allen Hulton , a 39 year veteran of the postal service, who provided a sworn affidavit to Maricopa County, AZ. Sheriff investigators.
Arpaio was leading an investigation to determine whether or notÂ former foreignÂ college student , Barack Obama, was eligible to be placed on Arizonaâ€™s 2012 election ballot. After reviewing Hultonâ€™s affidavit, it is apparent that 1960â€™s communist agitators and revolutionaries from the communist-inspired Weathermen Underground, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn were in fact the de facto adoptive parents to this foreign student destined to become the first illegitimate President of the United States. As a result, Obama was treated to the finest Ivy League education that communist backed money could buy as Hulton maintains that the Ayers told him that he was financing the education of a promising foreign student at Harvard. Hulton also testified that he met Obama while at the Ayerâ€™s home and he asked Obama what he going to do with all his education, to which Obama politely answered, â€œI am going to become the Presidentâ€. Readers should take note that this is an affidavit, and as such, is formally considered to be evidence, not conjecture or hearsay. There can be no other conclusion that the criminally convicted communist terrorist, Bill Ayers, began grooming Obama to become Americaâ€™s first communist President during Obamaâ€™s college years. Their relationship continues into the present time as it is on record thatÂ Ayers visited the White House Â in August of 2009. Please note the words â€œforeign studentâ€, which makes Obama ineligible to be in the White House.
Obamaâ€™s communist affiliations continued well into his adulthood and because of the good work of Joel Gilbert Â who discovered that Obama was active with a Weathermen Underground Â support group known asÂ The May 19th Communist Organization, in New York. Â Perhaps, this is why Ayers was visiting the White House. And speaking of Ayers and Dorne, adding more fuel to this communist fire, it is interesting to note that both Senior White House Advisors, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett were both Weatherman Underground â€œ Red Diaper Babies , in which they were the sonsÂ and daughters of well-to-do parents who desired communism and livedÂ out their dreams through their childrenâ€™s revolutionary activities. Other notable red-diaper babies also include such notables asÂ Rahm Emanuel Â andÂ Eric Holder . Jarrettâ€™s situation is particularly interesting in that her family and the Ayers family have been multi-generational friends which also included a marriage between the two families. Much of the Obama administration is a nest of communists and this should serve to gravely concern every American citizen. It was Ayers and Dorne who launched State Senatorial candidate Obamaâ€™s political career from their Hyde Park, IL. living room according to the late Larry Grathwohl a former FBI undercover operative who penetrated the Weathermen Underground. Hollywood could not write a movie this good, with this much intrigue.
Frank Chapman , a communist activist and a member of the communist front group known as the World Peace Council. ChapmanÂ clearly used the term â€œmoleâ€ to describe Obama. He said Obamaâ€™s political climb and subsequentÂ success in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries was â€œa dialectical leap ushering in a qualitatively new era of struggle.â€ Chapman further stated that, â€œMarx once compared revolutionary struggle with the work of the mole, who sometimes burrows so far beneath the ground that he leaves no trace of his movement on the surface. This is the old revolutionary â€˜mole,â€™ not only showing his traces on the surface but also breaking through. â€œ The Communist Party USA backs Obama to the hilt. â€ It is clear that Obama is their man! Obama is Putin 2.0.
The Middle East is turning away from the Petrodollar. Europe will soon abandon the dollar to buy Russian gas. The Petrodollar is the only thing of value backing the dollar. When the fall of the Petrodollar is complete, it will not take 30 days to witness the complete and utter destruction of this economy. Dr. Garrow believes when the economic collapse arrives, it will be masked with an EMP attack designed to accelerate the process of decline. In this scenario. the Naval War College predicts 90% of us will be dead within two years under these circumstances! And what is Obama doing about all of this? He is doing nothing!
To those who think this is far-fetched, read on and see what the defectors tell us is coming and it will be hard to deny Obamaâ€™s complicity.
Golitsynâ€™s Blueprint for Obama According to Golitsyn, the short-term strategic objective of the Russians is to achieve a technological convergence with the West solely on Russian terms and mostly through a series of one-sided disarmament agreements. He also stated that the Russians and the Americans would engage in joint military exercises just prior to Americaâ€™s fall and this is exactly what we find when we look at the historical record under Obama.
â€œIn 2010, American soldiers participated in theÂ 2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade Â alongside its European allies and members of theÂ CIS , marking the first time American soldiers have ever participated in the annual event on May 9. 
In 2010, American and Russian special forces conduct their first joint operation in Afghanistan and destroy four drug-producing labs that make heroin on October 31.Â Â (S. Shuster (Oct.2010).Â Russia returns to Afghanistan for drug raid . TIME Â World. Retrieved 6 February, 2010). 
In 2012, the United States, Russia and NATO hold missile defense exercises in Ottobrunn, Germany from March 26 to March 30. 
In 2012, Russian troops are allowed into the United States for the first time to participate in a joint U.S.-Russia military drill in Colorado on April 25. 
In 2012, American and Russian navies participate in theÂ RIMPAC 2012 Â naval exercises from June 29 to August 3 and this process is ongoing. 
In 2012, The United States and Russia hold joint naval exercises in the Norwegian Sea on August 22. 
In 2012, Russia sends aid to the United States in the aftermath ofÂ Hurricane Sandy Â on November 11. 
In 2013, American, Russian and NATO military forces perform a counter piracy exercise in the Gulf of Aden on February 26. 
In 2014, The United States, Russia and NATO announce plans to conduct a joint naval operation in the Mediterranean to protect a U.S. ship that will destroy Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons on February 14.â€ 
There are literally dozens more of these bilateral cooperative efforts involving the military forces of Russia and the United States. This is following a time when leaders like George Bush placed a missile shield in Poland and beefed up our support of NATO. It is clear that Obama is in bed with the Russians. AND PUTIN, OBAMA AND CLINTON ARE IN BED WITH THE GLOBALISTS WHO WANT WORLD WAR III.Â 
Golitsyn and the Scissors Plan Golitsyn Â stated that Russia, after lulling America to sleep, will join with China in order to attack the United States from both the outside and inside as he detailed thatÂ â€œ In each of these the scissors strategy will play its part; probably, as the final stroke, the scissors blades will close. The element of apparent duality in Soviet and Chinese policies will disappear. The hitherto concealed coordination between them will become visible and predominant. The Soviets and the Chinese will be officially reconciled. Thus the scissors strategy will develop logically into the â€˜strategy of one clenched fistâ€™ to provide the foundation and driving force of a world communist federationâ€Śbefore long, the communist strategists might be persuaded that the balance had swung irreversibly in their favor. In that event they might well decide on a Sino-Soviet â€˜reconciliation.â€™ The scissors strategy would give way to the strategy of â€œone clenched fist.â€Â The enemies now are gathered from within . At that point the shift in the political and military balance will be plain for all to see.
The inking of the recent energy deal which married the economies of the Russians and the Chinese is the manifestation of Golitsynâ€™s revelations.
As I stated earlier, the death of the Petrodollar means that you will not a have job to go to tomorrow. Because of Obama, the Chinese own our money. Which means they own your mortgage, retirement and savings accounts. Everything you own, is controlled by the Chinese. Soon, they will be coming to collect.
My insider military sources, as well as Dr. Garrow, tell me that plans for an American guerrilla warfare resistance are being put into play as we speak. This means that millions of us are going to die at the hands of foreign invaders and from being caught in the crossfire.
Conclusion I no longer believe in the America political process and for good reason (e.g. electronic voting machines). George Soros has proven what a rigged system we live under. Remember, Traitor-In-Chief #1 is Obama. Traitor-In-Chief #2 is Clinton and Hillary is the closer. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SOLD OUT FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE.

"title: Political Prisoner Takes on US Military-Industrial Complex author: Kim Petersen text: The ultimate underdog 23 Shares
9 12 0 2
Ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales, few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy David and the giant Goliath. In the biblical encounter, David prevailed by keeping his foe Goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon, his sling.
Today a modern-day version of David and Goliath is playing out.
Although granted political asylum by Ecuador, a target of US empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in Ecuador's London embassy under constant surveillance by British police. The fully weaponized US empire, which boasts of its full-spectrum dominance, has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed (as in having no conventional weaponry) man who heads a publishing organization.
This uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the military-economic (albeit faltering on both fronts) behemoth to the world's public. The pro-transparency publisher Wikileaks, its founder (and de facto political prisoner) Julian Assange, and anti-secrecy collaborators infuriated the United States establishment with a slew of documents, emails, and graphic exposes like the "" Collateral Murder "" video that demonstrated a US military engaged in war crimes.
Nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps. But it is a one-way street, as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question.
MORE... Swedish government implicated in charges against Assange UN body to rule on ""arbitrary detention"" of Wikileaks founder Web-savvy Wikileaks objects to this double standard, and it welcomes, vets, and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the public's right to be informed about what their government is up to.
Evidence makes it clear that the violent American establishment engages in browbeating, inciting so-called color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments, military encirclement, and saber rattling. This self-described indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as China and Russia was not about to have its full-spectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers.
Leaning on its allies, the US enacted a financing squeeze on Wikileaks. Many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by US sanctions, but tiny Wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the Washington schemers.
In an attempt to topple Wikileaks, the US establishment has sought to lop off the head of Wikileaks. It has kept close tabs on Julian Assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring Assange down in Sweden: ""We have been warned that the Pentagon, for example, is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us.""
In Sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape. In self-defense Assange spoke to the facts of the situation :
Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric?
... the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.
Disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire.
While in Britain, Assange was eventually placed under house arrest. Sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview Assange in Britain on the allegations. It insisted he come to Sweden, which Assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere, knowing full well that the US Department of Justice was preparing a case against him. Sweden refused to give such an assurance, which speaks strongly about Sweden's intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens.
Despite all this intrigue, Wikileaks has continued to publish and Assange has continued to give interviews. Assange did not cower, instead he chose to fight back against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This is because Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and Wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government.
Clinton and the Democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris. Along the way many outs presented themselves to the Democrats. They could have dropped the grand jury investigation. They could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for Assange's deportation from Sweden. The US could even have given a presidential pardon to Assange. Extremely telling about the caliber of man that Assange is, is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner, Chelsea Manning.
But empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire. Empire does not negotiate deals. It takes what it wants because it believes it can.
The result
The corruption in the Democratic party has come to light. Wikileaks revealed that the Democratic National Committee conspired against party aspirant Bernie Sanders and heads fell. Clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Clinton's emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair John Podesta. Revelations include ""pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations,"" a "" direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East,"" ""Libya, more than anyone else's war, was Hillary Clinton's war,"" and banks buying cabinet positions.
The Clinton campaign has, predictably, been thrown into disarray.
The Clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails. Instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere. The Clintonites blamed Russian hacking for interfering in the US presidential race. Finally, Julian Assange felt compelled to state :
The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source.
Neither is Wikileaks complicit with Russia:
We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.
Graciously toward Clinton, Assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to "" drone "" him. Imagine what the response would have been if Assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against Clinton.
Presently, Assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the Clinton campaign for the presidency.
Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he's had every establishment off side; Trump doesn't have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies... big foreign money ... are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves.
However, a counter coup was announced against the coup by ""Clinton cronyism."" It is said to include FBI, CIA, military intelligence, other security organizations ""through Julian Assange"" that have promised to stop Clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies.
A revolution?
No matter what transpires on November 8, the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental. US democracy has — again — been revealed to be glaringly corrupt. Most importantly, the world's preeminent military-industrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person. Properly framed, it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness, a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire."
"title: We Are about to Witness the Biggest Supermoon Since 1948 author: Anna LeMind text: We Are about to Witness the Biggest Supermoon Since 1948 Nov 10, 2016 0 0 
We are to witness something amazing on the eve of November 14 . On that day, the distance between our planet and the moon will be the shortest in almost 70 years! The last time it happened was in January 1948. 
Earth’s natural satellite will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in comparison with an average full moon. It is estimated that the next supermoon of this size will take place on 25 November 2034 , so make sure you don’t miss this beautiful celestial event (if the weather conditions in your region are favorable for skywatching, of course)! 
As NASA reports: 
“The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21 st century. The full moon won’t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.” What Is a Supermoon 
Almost all celestial bodies have elliptical orbits; that’s why the distance between our planet and the moon is not always the same. The further side of the moon’s orbit is called apogee and the closer one is called perigee. In short, when a full moon occurs on the perigee, then we get a supermoon phenomenon , which causes our natural satellite to appear closer and brighter in the night sky. 
While supermoons are quite frequent (this year, we will have three of those), the full moon of November 14 will be within approximately 2 hours of perigee , which makes it a truly rare phenomenon. How to Watch a Supermoon 
A perfect location to enjoy the coming supermoon (as well as any other astronomical phenomenon) is somewhere away from the city so that the urban lights don’t interfere with skywatching. 
Don’t forget that the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon is best seen to the human eye when the moon is close to the horizon. 
According to NASA, “ When the moon is near the horizon, it can look unnaturally large when viewed through trees, buildings, or other foreground objects.” 
The moon will be at the peak of its full phase and, therefore, will appear the biggest at 8:52am EST. For those of you living in Australia, the moon will reach its full phase at 12:52 a.m. AEST on November 15.

"title: We’re All Going To Lose On November 8th: Get Prepped With This Post-Election Chaos Checklist (VIDEO) author: Daisy Luther text: in: Preparedness\Survival , US News Darned if we do and darned if we don’t. That basically sums up the current election cycle. I’d go so far as to say that everybody loses during this election, especially if the promised chaos erupts when the winner is announced. Regardless of which candidate “wins” the presidential election, I have a bad feeling about the aftermath. I think we could be on the cusp of the most widespread civil unrest since the Civil War. If you are interested in getting prepared for it but don’t want to read over all of the frightening possibilities, go here and sign up for a Prepping Crash Course that will help you be ready for impending chaos in a mere 24 hours. For those who are wondering how things might go down, let’s look at some scenarios. If Trump wins… There is so much anti-Trump wrath among Progressives that violence has already erupted at campaign rallies. Trump supporters had eggs and bottles thrown at them in San Jose , a police car was smashed and nearly 20 were arrested at a violent protest in Orange County, and a man was even arrested for trying to grab a police officer’s gun to assassinate Trump . And look at what Clintonites did to this homeless woman who was trying to protect Donald Trump’s star from being further defaced on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. YouTube Notice how many of these mob-minded cowards it took to terrorise one homeless woman…Classy, right? Now, think about how these people will react if Trump is somehow elected. If you have a sign in your yard, you will be a target for their rage. Got a Trump/Pence sticker on your car? Expect that it could be defaced. Even more recently, Penn State students were “triggered” by a pro-Trump rally and began tearing down signs, swearing at the pro-Trump kids, and disrupting their event. What’s more, it isn’t just Social Justice Warriors and Progressives folks would need to worry about. A top activist in the group, Black Lives Matter, took to Twitter to inform everyone exactly what would happen if Trump were to win the presidency. This was deleted but is archived here . The tweet was followed by this one, which is still u p… Don’t delude yourself. With a Trump victory, trouble is coming. And don’t think living in a small town keeps you safe. The population of Ferguson, Missouri is barely over 20,000 people – hardly a metropolis. If Clinton wins… With the newly intensified investigation into her corruptio n, it hardly seems possible that she could still win this election, but her supporters seem blind to the crimes she has committed. Instead of looking at the facts, they’re saying “First woman president YA !!!” With all of the collusion , it seems like the FBI is fighting a tough battle to see her indicted. There once was a day that this suspicion would be enough to keep the American people from voting for a person who is blatantly in it for she can personally gain. The Wikileaks email scandal continues, with new revelations about our government leading to possible criminal proceedings, impeachment and heaven only knows what else. As well, there’s a very, very good chance that the election will be rigged . Somehow, despite all that is going on, Clinton’s campaign is still planning her celebratory fireworks party , scheduled to start several hours before all the votes could even be counted. If this happens, Trump supporters will be enraged – and justifiably so. Joe Walsh, a former congressman, has already tweeted he’s “grabbing his musket.” And Walsh is not alone. Many Americans are sick and tired of the blatant, in-our-faces corruption. There is talk of revolution and even a quiet counter-coup going on behind the scenes. Others concur that unrest is coming. I’m not the only blogger out here in Bloggerland who thinks all hell will break loose regardless of who becomes presidents. Mike Adams of Natural News wrote , “My ANALYSIS of possible outcomes from the upcoming presidential election reveals that America only has a 5% chance of remaining peaceful after November 8. This does not mean the violence will occur on November 9th, but rather that events will be set into motion on that day which will lead to an escalation of violence (95% chance…) Check out his predictions of the possible scenarios . And from the more liberal side of the unrest coin, an essayist for Cracked.com still comes to a similar conclusion. “Over the last few weeks a growing number of people have started wondering, “Is it possible the United States is heading for a new civil war?”…Every time I wanted to dismiss those headlines I thought about my visit to Ukraine last year, to cover their ongoing civil war . The most common sentence I heard was, “It’s like a bad dream.” Up to the minute the shooting started, almost no one thought civil war was a serious possibility.” You need to get prepped. Immediately. What it all boils down to is that we need to be prepared. We need to be ready for any unrest that comes about as a direct result of the election – and I really believe that there will be some form of uprising against the result. I hope it will be nothing more than a few minor, isolated incidents, but I can’t get past the niggling feeling that all hell is just about to break loose. November 7 could be the last day of normalcy for quite some time. The governments of Germany and the Czech Republic have told their citizens to stock up on food, water and basic survival supplies in case of a national emergency. We need to be doing the same. If you would like to take a class to help you prepare for this, you can learn more here. If you don’t want to invest in a class, use this FREE handy checklist to make sure you’ll have everything you need. Post-Election Chaos Checklist Make sure everything is in order. While it’s unlikely that services like internet, electricity, and municipal water will be affected, it doesn’t hurt to be ready for that possibility. The key here is to make certain you don’t have to leave your home for the duration of the unrest, should it come your way. Check your pantry and fill any gaps in your food preps. Order emergency food buckets – if you order right away there is still time to get them before the election."
"title: DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN author: Iron Sheik text: Home › POLITICS | US NEWS › DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN 0 SHARES 
[10/27/16] Republican nominee Donald Trump is now within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. 
In the latest Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll , Trump trails Clinton by just six points. In the four-way poll, Clinton received 48 percent, Trump received 42 percent, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4.5 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 1 percent. Clinton led Trump 50 percent to 44 percent, in the head-to-head. 
Fifty-nine percent of polled voters said that jobs and the economy are the most important issues, while 29 percent said that national defense and terrorism were most important. 
A Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll places Clinton ahead of Trump by 7 points, which is still a significant narrowing compared to previous polls. 
Public backlash against trade deals like President Barack Obama’s Tran-Pacific Partnership – a deal that Clinton once called “the gold standard in trade agreements”– was so fierce that Clinton changed her tune during the Democratic primary where she was defeated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
“Across Michigan, Republicans are coming home and taking a united stand against Hillary Clinton’s radical, open-borders agenda and plan to double-down on failed Obama policies, such as Obamacare. We are also seeing independents, Democrats and union workers saying no to Clinton’s special interest driven agenda, and yes to Mr. Trump’s plan to put America first,” Tim Lineberger, communications director for Trump’s Michigan campaign team told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
“Hard working Americans will be voting for change in November because they feel like the system is rigged against them, and they know that Clinton and her cohorts are the ones rigging it,” Lineberger added. 
Clinton was previously caught on tape telling a group of foreign bankers that her dream was a “hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.” Trump is also hoping to capitalize on the government’s recent report, stating that the price of Obamacare premiums are expected to increase an average of 22 percent.

"title: Dilbert Creator Explains “How Do I Know The Emails Are That Bad?” author: Zero Hedge text: 
If you’re following the news, you know FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI found a bunch of emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop.
As Dilbert Creator Scott Adams notes, there appears to be two main observations:
1. Comey seemed pro-Clinton when he dropped the initial email case.
2. Comey seems anti-Clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election.
So, how can both behaviors be explained? 
First some background from Adams on ‘The Persuasion Filter’ :
As my regular readers know, the Persuasion Filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality . In order for us to be here today, our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate. They had no need to understand reality at any basic level. And we have no such need either. That’s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and I might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine. Many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival. I like to describe reality as each person living their own movie, which works well unless our script’s conflict. When that happens, one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent. 
That’s how I see the world.
Last year in this blog I suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what I call the Persuasion Filter. That’s what I have been using to make spooky-good predictions about the election so far. And that’s what I’ll use today to give you an alternate movie about James Comey. Compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future.
The base assumption of the Persuasion Filter is that people are irrational 90% of the time and only rarely – when no emotions are involved – truly rational. This is the reverse of the common filter for reality, in which people are assumed to be rational 90% of the time and a bit crazy 10% of the time. That’s some background for context.

So, back to Comey, Adams asks – which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future? 
Some say Comey is a political pawn in a rigged system. By that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case. But we can’t explain why he’s acting against Clinton’s interests now. What changed?
Well, some say Comey had to reopen the case against Clinton after discovering the Weiner laptop emails. If he failed to act, there might be a revolt at the FBI and maybe a whistleblower would come forward . But that leaves unexplained why Comey detailed to Congress how Clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the FBI was dropping the case. If Comey had been protecting Clinton on the first round, he would have softened his description of her misdeeds, wouldn’t he? But he didn’t seem to hold back anything.
And none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know Comey have high regard for his integrity. Comey also has the security of a 10-year appointment as Director, so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced. That’s exactly why the job has a 10-year term. Given what we know of Comey before any of the Clinton emails, any movie that casts Comey as an ass-covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake.
So allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts Comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass-covering weasel. Compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting.
My movie says Comey had good evidence against Clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the American public . For reasons of conscience, and acting as a patriot, Comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the FBI found against Clinton. The evidence looked damning because it was. Under this interpretation, Comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the Republic. He didn’t want the FBI to steal this important decision away from the people, but at the same time he couldn’t let the people decide blind. So he divulged the evidence and stepped away, like the action hero who doesn’t look back at the explosion. 
In the second act of this movie, Comey learns that the Weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag. And a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence. That would violate Clinton’s rights.
But Comey couldn’t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against FBI policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day. So Comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the Republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting. 
In this movie, Comey did the hero thing. He alerted the public to the fact that the FBI found DISQUALIFYING information on the Weiner laptop. And he took a second bullet to his reputation. 
How do I know the new emails are that bad? 
I start by assuming Comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions. And even Comey’s critics concede he’s smart. 
So…
The way you know the new emails are disqualifying for Clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed Congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections. Comey is smart enough to know his options. And unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age, he’s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the Republic.
According to this movie, no matter who gets elected, we’ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the Weiner emails.
And we can’t say we weren’t warned. Comey took two bullets to do it. 
So compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts. And when we find out what is in the Weiner laptop emails, compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifying.
The Persuasion Filter says there is no preferred reality. We all see our own movies. In my movie, Comey’s has a consistent personality from start to finish. He starts out his career as a smart, competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the Republic. If your movie script has Comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season, don’t expect an Oscar.

Of course if you’re a Democrat, this is all irrelevant and Comey is “A Putin puppet” (Howard Dean), “a federal law-breaker who should never have been appointed” (Harry Reid), and “a partisan, prejudiced individual” (Eric Holder)…

"title: Comment on Man of Sin: Obama says illegal aliens can vote because they are U.S. citizens by Christian Zionist author: Christian Zionist text: Posted on November 6, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 9 Comments 
Barack Obama, a sitting President of the U.S. of A., not only tells a bald-faced lie — that “undocumented immigrants,” i.e., illegal aliens, are U.S. citizens — he actively encourages illegals to vote, with impunity. 
What a slap in the face of countless people across the world who actually respect this country’s laws by applying to immigrate to the United States. 
Here’s the video, followed by my transcript: 
Woman who identifies herself as a Millenial “ Dreamer ,” i.e., she illegally came into the U.S. when she was a minor (defined as younger than 16 years old): “The Millenial Dreamers, undocumented citizens — and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country — are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will Immigration know where I live, will they come for my family and deport us?” 
Obama: “Not true, and the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation when the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.” 
Words no longer have meaning: “Undocumented citizens” is a new Orwellian oxymoron. 
Recall that Obama had studied Constitutional law at Harvard Law School. His course of study must have been How to Subvert the U.S. Constitution. 
Why isn’t Congress impeaching this outlaw and disgrace to the presidency?

Trends Russian anti-terror op in Syria , Syria unrest 
Targeting Russia was “a gross misstep on the part of the human rights defenders,” Konstantin Dolgov said. 
“If they call themselves [human rights defenders] they have to be objective. Al least, they have to try to be impartial. How can they assess the human rights situation in Syria in this one-sided manner? Just to join the chorus of Western governments and politicians, groundlessly accusing Russia of bombing civilian targets in Syria, without providing any evidence of this,” Dolgov added.

The NGOs, which failed to provide any solid proof of Russia’s alleged wrongdoings, “completely ignore the bulk of the problem” in Syria, the commissioner stressed. “And the bulk of the problem is the activities of the terrorist organizations like Islamic State, [Jabhat] al-Nusra… which have been persistently killing dozens of thousands of civilians in Syria.” 
Dolgov wondered “how can those NGOs ignore… numerous killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure by the coalition led by the US?” when “there are multiple examples” of such violations. 
“If you’re against violations of human rights, you should be against violation everywhere and by everybody,” he said. 
The commissioner pointed out that, on Wednesday, Amnesty International – which had not signed the petition – blamed the US for killing hundreds of civilians in Syria and refusing to investigate those incidents. 
The numbers of civilian victims provided by the group – around 300 – “aren’t complete,” Dolgov said. 
“I don’t think that an accurate number. I don’t think anybody there has an accurate number.” Read more Over 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria 
More than 80 international organizations – including Human Rights Watch, CARE International and Refugees International – have signed a petition for Russia to be thrown off the UN Human Rights Council. They claimed that Moscow was no longer fit to hold its position in the United Nations body, due to its military operation in Syria. 
It turned out that most of the organizations are part of the very same Syria Relief Network based in Turkey, however, casting potential doubts over their impartiality. 
The petition came ahead of the UN Human Rights Council election, scheduled to take place on Friday. The Foreign Ministry official opted not to predict the outcome of the vote, but said that Russia was “definitely” running to regain its seat on the council. 
“We’re running because we have a very strong record in the protection of international law; in the protection of international human rights law. We don’t have right now, at this last moment before the election, to prove anything. Our policies are well known and we’ve been one of the most active and creative members of the UN Human Rights Council for many-many years now,” Dolgov stressed.

Moscow is aware that there some international players who want to block Russia’s activities in the Human Rights Council, because “we’re not professing double standards. We are consistently against politicizing human rights. We have a lot of supporters,” Dolgov added."
